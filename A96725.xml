            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F this Book were ſet forth in any other Language, for Forreigners to read, I were unavoidably driven to give them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why I had put my ſelf upon ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and ſo unneceſſary an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as to extoll and commend that, whoſe worth and merit is owned by all the World, and which every where ſhines ſo brightly, that it cannot be obſcured by any, either Tongue, or Pen.</p>
                  <p>For it is very well known to them, that the Civil Law is the iſſue and product of that great and mighty State, the Roman Empire, that led ſo many Nations and people captive by their Wiſdome, as much as by their Valour; that was once the School of all Moral Honeſty and goodneſs, and the ſtage, whereon the whole variety of humane affairs was repreſented.</p>
                  <p>Neither need I tell them, that what through the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſucceſs of that State, for which it was ordained, and what through the natural Equity that is to be read
<pb facs="tcp:115997:3"/>all along in it, and its being fitted for the general affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Laws of moſt of the Europaean Nations (who indeed all of them anciently were ſubject to the Roman Government) are but as copies drawn from that original, borrowing that luſtre of goodneſs they have, from it; and where their particular Laws faile, thither their Judicatories reſort to be ſupplied.</p>
                  <p>They cannot be ignorant, That though every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nation has ſome few Laws of their own, proper for their occaſions, government, and people; yet no where beyond the Seas is there any profeſſion or ſcience of Law, but this; nor any Law accounted the Law of Nations, but the Civil Law onely: That time, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, argument, and applying it to the ſeveral affairs of ſo many Nations where it has been uſed, has made it ſo perfect and ſo ſufficient a body to decide all caſes by, that are between party and party, and do not concern the publick government, that they ſtand in need of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few Laws of their own making; and without it no Laws they can make, would ever be able to ſerve their turn.</p>
                  <p>To thoſe therefore that make ſuch continual uſe of this Law in their Courts, and who ſuffer none to ſit as Judges, nor plead at their Bars, but ſuch as have been brought up in that faculty, and who ſtrive to imploy thoſe onely in all tranſactions between themſelves and other Nations: to them, I ſay, to praiſe and applaud this Law, that is dignified by them ſo many ſeveral wayes, is ſo little needful, that it were almoſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
                  <p>But to make known to the people of this Nation to whom it is rendred now ſo contemptible, how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it is in it ſelf, how rational; what a general appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb facs="tcp:115997:3"/>it has had with other Nations, and how very uſeful it may be to the publick welfare of this Nation divers wayes, it is a work ſo ſeaſonable and neceſſary, that it may be done without either Apology, Preface, or reaſon premiſed; and is no more then the preſent ſtate of things calls for.</p>
                  <p>For when it is conſidered, what an account it has been in amongſt us for many hundred years together; how many cauſes, Civil, Eccleſiaſtical, Maritime, and Military, it dealt in how the juriſdiction thereof ran through the whole Nation; how very little it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the profeſſion of the Common-Law it ſelf, how many profeſſours and practiſers it maintained, and how much it did enrich them; what a number of ſtudents it encouraged; what coercive power it was intruſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and the many Courts the employment thereof lay in: And when we ſee, that now the cauſes thereof are cantonized, and like a ſpoyl divided; ſome carried to the Courts of Common-Law, ſome to the Court of Equity, others ſent into the Countrey, ſome left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any rule or regulation at all, and nothing left entire to the Civil Law; and when the ſolid reaſon of that Law is crowded out by vulgar reaſon, the profeſſours thereof ſcattered, the ſtudy thereof diſcontinued, the very Law-books for want of uſe here, all tranſported beyond ſea to other Nations, and all coercion taken away; It is ſo much worth the enquiring what the ground of this great change ſhould be, that to be ſilent thereat were great ſtupidity.</p>
                  <p>That the fall of the Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction might be a reaſon to ſuſpend the exerciſe of that profeſſion in ſome cauſes for a time, till it were again ſetled, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. But why it ſhould not under this preſent form of
<pb facs="tcp:115997:4"/>Government (if authority think fit) be reſtored again, as to a civil regulation of thoſe very matters under the Civil Magiſtrate, no ſatisfactory reaſon can be rendred. I am ſure, it can neither be rational, nor convenient, that they ſhould be carried from the Civil Law, which was the known, eſtabliſhed, and practiſed Law in thoſe matters, unto the conizance of thoſe, that have neither Law, nor rule, nor skill to try them; eſpecially when the ſo doing does inevitably draw after it the certain ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of that whole profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore very-well worthy the moſt ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe that ſit at the Helme; That, ſince there muſt be a triall of thoſe matters ſtill, and a gain attending thereupon to one or other, (which is the Game every body hunts after:) <hi>Whether the Publick is more concerned, that the profit of ſuch coniſances ſhould flow into the purſes of others, no way apt or skilful, then go to the maintaining and keeping up of ſuch a learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, which this Nation cannot be without.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly, whenſoever we ſee that profeſſion laid aſide (which for the publick good, I truſt, I never ſhall) we ſhall find this Common-wealth of ours made very much inferiour and unequal to other Nations, with whom (as it is an Iſland, and now become an active one) it has and muſt have many wayes to do. In other things, as in ſtrength, riches, and alliances, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for advantage and ſuperiority with them, why ſhould we then ſuffer them to over-match us in wit, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, skill, knowledge, wiſdome, policy, reaſon, or judgment, which that learning above all other, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience together gives them?</p>
                  <p>The dealings that we may have with them, as they are not a few, but innumerable, even as many as there
<pb facs="tcp:115997:4"/>are things in the World to deal in: So ſome of them are of higheſt moment and conſequence alſo; As, <hi>Right to Kingdomes or Provinces, by Donation, last Will, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion, or by Marriage; community or property of the Sea, and the rights of Fiſhing and trading there; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from Cuſtomes and other immunities granted to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Merchants; Precedency, amongst the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Princes and Republicks; Promiſes of protection and aide againſt enemies; Entertainment and harbouring of Traytors or Rebels; Interpretation of publick Leagues or National Contracts; Not admitting of Embaſſadours, or detaining them, or uſing them in any uncivil manner; Making of War, or contracting of Peace; Sending ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to our enemies, or oppreſsing our friends and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; Imbargo's, ſeizing upon our Merchants goods at land, or ſtopping our ſhips or goods at Sea; The arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of differences between Nation and Nation, frequently referred to Princes or other States; Of the force of Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Contracts, and of their duration, whether they ſhall bind ſucceſſours, or die with the Princes that made them; Latitude of Territory and juriſdiction, either upon Sea or Land.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like are the tranſactions and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that may be frequently agitated &amp; dealt in between us and other Nations; wherein before we fall to an open War, we chuſe to reaſon and expoſtulate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them; ſometimes we think it neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the right of our cauſe to other Nations; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to declare the ſtate of the buſineſs to our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Neither of which can be done effectually and with advantage, nor ſhall we be able to hold any ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment convincingly, if we have not the perfect knowledg of the Law of Nations and the learning of the Civil Law; which to be ſure, is the onely kind of Reaſon,
<pb facs="tcp:115997:5"/>that other Nations (knowing no other Common Law or Rule beſides it for ſuch matters) will encounter us withall.</p>
                  <p>And ſince we have ſuch great need at this time of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by Land, and Navies by Sea, to defend us from factions at home, and enemies abroad, I would put it to thoſe of the Military order, to conſider, how not onely uſefull, but neceſſary that profeſſion is for carrying on of Military buſineſs alſo, as well by ſea, as by land; &amp; that all the military diſcipline, &amp; good government that they have in their Armies, and the right which they are enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to afford to their very enemies, is directed by the rules and principles of that profeſſion: for it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the Municipal Law, as to the carrying on of Martial affairs, is altogether impertinent, and of no uſe at all; the ſame being a Law uſeful but in peace onely.</p>
                  <p>But there are peculiar Laws, and a proper diſcipline for the ſtate of War; <hi>Sunt &amp; belli ſicut &amp; pacis jura;</hi> and they are accommodated to the very nature and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of it: ſome of which are, <hi>That there be ſolemn denouncing of the war intended, that all diſſenters may withdraw in time, and to divert other Nations from adhering; That it be proſecuted by juſt and honourable ways, without treachery, corruption, breach of faith, poyſon, or ſecret aſſaſsination,</hi> which the gallant Romans did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to act, though for never ſo great a victory: <hi>That all articles and capitulations made be ſtrictly kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, even towards Turkes, Pagans, Jews, or Infidels; That they be interpreted in the plaineſt and moſt equitable ſenſe, without any art or ſubtilty at all; That an enemy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has yielded himſelf, be not kill'd, but kept alive for exchange, or ranſome; That what is gotten from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, is good and lawful purchaſe, though it was newly taken
<pb facs="tcp:115997:5"/>from ſome of our own people or confederates, ſo that it were but once brought ſafe into the enemies Quarters; That the enemies countrey, when it offers to yield, be not laid waſte, burnt, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; That when a Town is to be ſtormed, women, children, aged, Eccleſiastical perſons, ſo far as is poſsible, may be ſpared; That it be free to friends or confederates to trade with the enemy, ſo they carry neither victuals, money, armes, or ammunition; That the Countrey, through which the Army paſſes, no offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, be not injured, but kept from ſpoyl and rapine; That Heraulds or meſſengers ſent from the enemy be received and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed with ſafety; That ſtrictneſs and ſeverity of diſcipline, greater then in peace, be maintained within the Camp; the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant advanced to honours, and admitted to partake in the ſpoyl which he did help to get; the cowardly diſgraced, the diſobedient rigorouſly chastiſed, the incorrigable caſhiered, and the aged and worn out ſouldier be diſmiſſed to eaſe with reward and honour; That a difference of degrees be obſerved, and a ſubordination made, as the places of command differ; That for Military offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or contracts and promiſes made between ſouldier and ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the coniſance thereof be in the Court Marſhall, and to be tried by the Law of Armes onely; That Hoſtages be taken and kept, and may be put to death, if the enemy prove perfidious; That neither friends goods coming in an enemies bottome, nor a friends ſhip, though carrying enemies goods in her, be taken as prize; That when a victory is gotten, the enemy ſubdued be uſed with all clemency and moderation; That Priviledges be granted to ſouldiers beyond other men;</hi> with an infinite number more, which are no where to be found collected and laid together, but in the books and writings of the Civil Law; which is the onely proper learning to teach and inſtruct in thoſe matters.</p>
                  <p>For it has been the Civilians work, to draw together as it were into one body and Syſteme, all that the Civil Law it ſelf does afford; and whatſoever elſe can be gathered from
<pb facs="tcp:115997:6"/>the teſtimonies of the ancient Philoſophers, Hiſtorians, Poets, and Orators, in what they are all, as it were by the light of nature, conſenting in one and the ſame judgment; alſo what has been delivered by the ancient Fathers and moſt approved Canons of the Church on that ſubject; and eſpecially to bring into argument, what has been conſtantly upon the ſame occurrences in war, judg'd and practiſed by the moſt War-like and Heroick Nations, that have been; as the Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Aſſyrians, Medes, Perſians, Lacedaemonians, Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but eſpecially the Romans, with whom for experience &amp; diſcipline in War, and juſtice and bravery towards their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; no Nation that ever acted on this great Theatre of the World, is to be compared: And ſo by theſe helps, the Laws of War in uſe at this day, have been made and perfected, only through the Civilians pains and induſtry; neither are they to be met with any where together, but in their books and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſince this profeſſion is ſo uſeful and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the ſouldiers buſineſs alſo, that they cannot promiſe to themſelves any good order, wiſe conduct, or happy ſucceſs with their Martial enterprizes, but by that light and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it affords, it is evident, that it could never be worſe ſpared or diſcountenanced; then now at this time. Which I humbly leave to be further thought of by the wiſdome of thoſe that rule over us.</p>
                  <p>And ſo deſiring thee to excuſe me this once, for appearing thus in publick, being upon ſo preſſing an occaſion, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive (if by ſuch weak endeavours it were poſsible) a whole profeſsion, almoſt quite expiring, I bid thee farewell, and remaine,</p>

For whether the rights of a people be prejudiced by an irregular way of bringing them to trial and iudgement, or by the iniquitie of thoſe Lawes that ſhall judge them in the end, the miſchief is all one. A State therefore that will ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, for defence of their peoples rights, muſt not onely take care that the Lawes that muſt definitively over-rule and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, be equal, juſt, and rational, but the formes of trial muſt be the ſame alſo, that the ſame ſecurity and juſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which is the end of both, may be obtained.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, Falſhood doth ſo ſeck to cloath it ſelf with the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and appearance of truth, that none of the ordinary ſort of men, and not all of the beſt rank neither, can diſcover or diſtinguiſh true and ſolid reaſon from that which is falſe and counterfeit. When therefore our own natural inſtinct &amp; inbred knowledge beares witneſſe to any thing, &amp; we have the warrant and allowance of the Law for it beſides, no falſe colours or ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of reaſon can deceive us: for what the wiſdome and experience of a Nation has agreed and declared to be juſt and convenient, and our hearts do own and allow to be ſo, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably carries it in the greateſt evidence and certainty of true and pure reaſon, that mortal men can attain to in things of humane and civil intercourſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Lawes of Reaſon, which, Man retaining his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal integrity, had been ſufficient to direct each particular perſon in all his affaires and duties, are not of themſelves ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but do require the acceſſe of other Lawe, now that Man and his off-ſpring are grown thus corrupt and ſinful. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greateſt part of men are ſuch as prefer their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate good before all things, even that good which is ſenſual, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever is moſt Divine: and for that the labour or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, together with the pleaſure ariſing from the contrary, doth make men for the moſt part ſlower to the one, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the other; therefore unto Lawes it hath ſeemed alwayes needful to adde rewards, which more allure unto good then any hardneſſe deterreth from it; and puniſhments which may more deter from evil, than any ſweetneſſe thereto allureth, wherein as the generality and ſubſtance is natural, Vertue rewardable, and Vice puniſhable; ſo the particular determination of the reward or puniſhment, and all other circumſtances is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when men are rebuked for acting contrary to the Law of Nature, and the Light of Reaſon, what one amongſt them commonly doth not ſtomack at ſuch contradiction, ſtorm
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115997:20"/>at reproof, and hate ſuch as would reform them. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding even they which brook it worſt, that men ſhould tell them of their duties, when they are told the ſame by a Law, think very well and reaſonably of it. Becauſe they preſume that the Law doth ſpeak with all indifferency; that the Law hath no ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect to their perſons; that the Law is as it were an Oracle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from wiſdome and underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, that what Reaſon it ſelf preſcribeth, may in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry conſiderations be expedient to be ratified by a humane Law, and indeed that a humane Law ought in ſubſtance to hold forth nothing which Reaſon allowes not of.</p>

                        <p>What is here meant and intended by Reaſon?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt leſt there ſhould be any miſtake touching the neceſſary quality of Reaſon, which we ſo ſtictly require in a Law, it is but needful that we ſhould explain what we intend by Reaſon. For certainly there is not a more deceitful thing than Reaſon; it being made uſe of frequently by falſe ſhews and colours to beautifie the fouleſt and moſt deformed things, and is grown to be the common gloſs that every evil does varniſh and deck it ſelf withall: alſo it is ſuch a faculty, that thoſe that are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it in the meaneſt meaſure, do infinitely extoll and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire what they apprehend to be reaſonable, though to a right judgement it be nothing ſo; and what they have not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding enough to conceive through their own natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they do as much diſdain and condemn, how judicious and ſolid ſoever it be. Although therefore the plainer a Law is, and the more obvious to the underſtanding of thoſe that are to be guided by it, the better and the more commendable that Law muſt needs be; yet we would not have it thought, that we allow no Law to be good, but what every man that is bound by it, does immediately underſtand and approve of. For,</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:115997:20"/>
                     <p>We cannot admit that the capacities of common men are ſufficient to judge of Lawes, which may be rational enough, though the reaſon of them be not ſeen to them: yet the main principles of reaſon are in themſelves apparent, and diſcernable by every eye, and it is not eaſie to finde men ignorant of them; and therefore a Law that is contrary to thoſe common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is to be abhorred. But beſides thoſe that are univerſally received and agreed on, there are other principles which are not in themſelves ſo evident, but are deduction and inferences from the firſt; and which learned and very underſtanding men onely are capable by much diſcourſe and reaſoning to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. And here beſides good natural faculties, and ripe neſſe of years, there muſt be added the right helps of true Art and Learning; ſince Education and Inſtruction are the means, the one by uſe, the other by precept, to make our natural faculty of Reaſon both the better and the ſooner able to judge rightly between Truth and Errour, Good and Evil. Nay, it it not all kind of Learning neither, which will give a man a fitneſs to diſcern, whether the Law of a Nation be conformable to right Reaſon or not; but it muſt be either all Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge joyned together, or that proper legal knowledge, which is <hi>Ars aequi &amp; boni, juſti atque injuſti Scientia,</hi> the art of Equity &amp; a good Conſcience, the knowledge of Right &amp; Wrong. Further, the Judgement is not yet come to a full degree of perfectneſs, nor competent enongh, except it be fortified with a practical Knowledge too, and with a Wiſdome ariſing from Experience and Obſervation; for he that will undertake to judge whether a Law be agreeable to natural Equity and good Reaſon, he muſt not take his eſtimate from the matter of the Law one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he muſt conſider divers other circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt. He muſt ſee into the Nature, Manners, and Inclinations of the People: for the end of all Law being but to preſerve the Publick Peace, and to keep the people in good order<note n="d" place="margin">Salus populi ſuprema ltx eſt.</note>, that Law muſt needs be beſt and moſt rational, which does ſooneſt produce that end. And therefore conſidering that men, even by the very climate they live under, are made to differ ſo mainly in every thing, Body, Soul, Religion, and Manners, from the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115997:21"/>ſtrange variety of Lawes, which we ſee and read of throughout the world, we cannot preſently conclude any of them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable.</p>

But foraſmuch as none did ſo uſually offend this way as men in that caſe, which they wittingly fell into, even becauſe they would be ſo much the more freely outragious; it was for their publick good where ſuch diſorder was grown, to frame a poſitive Law or Remedy thereof accordingly.

And yet all this while here is no repugnancy to Nature neither; for the general principle of nature and of Nations, which is to puniſh offences that are paſt, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them for the future, is ſtill obſerved; onely it being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to ſeveral nations which are various and differing, it cannot poſſibly be executed by the ſame coertion or penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor in one and the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the form and kind of Goverment muſt be reſpected alſo; for ſome Laws may be judged very good and fitting for a Monarchy, which cannot be ſo accounted of in a Government by a few, or by the whole people, or in ſuch a one as is mixed, and made up out of them all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, when a Juſtice of the Law is doubted, it muſt be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, what urgency of affairs there was at that time when the Law was made, and whether ſome neceſſity and great reaſon of State did not enforce it.

                     <p>Fourthly, A Law that may be miſchievous to divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, though otherwiſe very innocent, muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be preſently condemned as unreaſonable, ſo that it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and profitable for the publick welfare. <hi>Jura non in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulas perſonas, ſed generaliter conſtituuntur,</hi>

                     <p>Fifthly, A Nationall Law that is generally and in moſt of its dictates and principles very juſt and equitable, and univerſally ſo acknowledg'd by the wiſeſt and moſt judicious men and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not to be cenſured for ſome few particular conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may ſeem hard and rigorous, or whereof the Juſtice, Equity, or Reaſon, is not ſo evident; for this enterpriſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Lawes is the weightieſt thing which any man can take upon him. And where a multitude of Laws comes to be made by men (the beſt of whom are ſubject unto errors) and for caſes of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number &amp; wonderful variety, ſome few deviations, if any be, may be excuſed. It may well ſuffice that the Body is fair, and the Specks but few.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, we can by no meanes allow of their way of judging, who are ready to meaſure the goodneſſe of Lawes by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and evill practiſes of thoſe that are inſtrumental to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter them. Neither are Lawes to be judged ſuch as their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is. Can a fountaine be judged the worſe, becauſe it is ſo unhappy as to run through a foule and ſlimy channell? or a chaſt Matron traduced, becauſe violence has polluted her? ſo neither can the Law be juſtly charged with the exorbitancies of men, which it ſelf condemns, and was purpoſely made to revenge and puniſh them; and would do ſo too, if violence, power, and fraud did not obſtruct its courſe.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, we can as little eſteem thoſe competent and fitting Judges of a Law, that are ſo forward to aſperſe and make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115997:22"/>becauſe by ancient inſtitution it was once miniſterial, and attended upon a power and function which they ever diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, and have lately ſeen aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Upon this ground and no other that can be imagined, have divers uttered their bitter and contumelious invectives againſt the <hi>Roman Civil Law,</hi> having been helpfull in the exerciſe of the Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction of this Nation: which becauſe they ſee eradicated and quite taken away, they judge the other quite uſeleſſe, and therefore in their conceit ought not to be kept or continued here any longer.</p>
                     <p>In which argument were there any ſtrength of Reaſon, it might be more ſtrongly enforc'd againſt the <hi>Commmon Law</hi> it ſelfe; the intent and ſcope whereof, being to ſet up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an abſolute ſucceſſive Monarchy in this Nation, and to keep the people in a ſubjection under it; that Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now thrown down, it may be inferr'd, that the Law alſo which did found and ſupport it, ſhould never be made uſe of more, and that a Law of greater liberty and freedome ſhould be ſet up in place of it: and ſo in concluſion, the reaſon of theſe diſputants would allow us no Law at all.</p>
                     <p>But theſe muſt not be ignorant, that the <hi>Civil Law</hi> was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally made leaſt of all for Eccleſiaſticall matters, nor yet for ſo few caſes, as in this Nation it was permitted to deal in: but it was firſt ordained, to guide the mightieſt and vaſteſt Empire that the world hath yet known; and under it the ſame grew and proſpered, to the terror of its enemies, the joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of its friends and confederates, and to the aſtoniſhment of the whole Earth. Indeed before the firſt foundations of this Law were laid, the <hi>Romans</hi> did not diſdaine to fetch their Lawes from <hi>Athens,</hi> that City which was once the nurſe of Reaſon, and flouriſht in eloquence and brave atchievements more then all <hi>Greece,</hi> whence the learned Fathers of the Church ſuckt literature; <hi>Baſil</hi> his eloquence, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> his ſtrength, and others their flowing Oratory; that <hi>Athens,</hi> which who had not ſeen, is by <hi>Lyſippus</hi> accounted a very block. But ſince this beautifull fabrick of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> was reared up, and came to the perfection we now ſee it in, it did not onely order and compoſe all matters of publick Juſtice, and of private Right
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115997:23"/>in that State, but is ſince, through the ſingular treaſures of Wiſdome and pureſt Reaſon laid up there, propagated alſo to other Nations, who conſtantly uſe it in their Courts, in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with their own Lawes. And in conformity to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did it come to paſſe, that the uſe of it was admitted, and brought into the Eccleſiaſticall, and other Courts of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where naturall Equity and the beſt Reaſon came to be diſpenſed, in the doing of right and juſtice; and eſpecially for commerce with Nations abroad, whereunto that knowledge is moſt requiſite.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to ſay that the <hi>Civil Law</hi> is uſeleſſe, becauſe the Eccleſiaſticall power is thrown out, is as much as if we ſaid, we have no further need of naturall Equity, or right Reaſon, nor need to treat with forreign Nations any longer, nor now be ſo wiſe as we have been, and as other Nations are.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, though the wiſeſt of a people have upon mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation agreed upon a Law, and the Legiſlative power of the Nation has enacted it, yet that does not preſently conclude the ſame to be rationall: for ſince the people of other Nations are partakers of the ſame Nature, Reaſon, Learning, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience with them, except it can appear rationall to others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that are taught and guided by the ſame principles, it is not to be deemed rationall.</p>
                     <p>And from this ſingle ground onely was it, that the <hi>Roman Civil Law</hi> came to be ſo univerſally embraced by other Nations, and to paſſe ſo generally for a moſt rationall and juſt Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more naturall and common principles of Reaſon, Juſtice and Equity were found therein, then in any other Law of Mans ordaining; and becauſe we meet with that reaſon there, that is univerſall and common to all mankind.</p>
                     <p>And if there be any certainty of Reaſon in matters of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſcourſe, (as we muſt admit there is, elſe we ſhall put out one of the chiefeſt lights that God has given to the world) it is to be diſcovered no where ſooner, then from that, which not onely one whole Nation has agrred upon and eſtabliſhed for a Law amongſt themſelves, but which other Nations beſides them, have allowed for true reaſon, and practiſed the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo within their ſeverall territories for many hundreds of years
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115997:23"/>together; for the moſt certain token of evident reaſon is, if the generall perſwaſion of all men doe ſo account it, and when the judgements of all men generally, or for the moſt part, run one and the ſame way. <hi>Non poteſt error contingere, ubi omnes idem opinantur; &amp; quicquid in omnibus individuis unius speciei com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniter ineſt, id cauſam communem habeat oportet, quae eſt eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum individuorum species &amp; natura.</hi> No error is to be feared in ſuch matters where all men are of the ſame opinion; and what is ingrafted in every individuall of the ſame ſpecies, muſt neceſſarily proceed from one common cauſe, which is nothing but their very nature. The generall and perpetuall voice of Men, is as the ſentence of God himſelf; for that which all men have at all times learned, Nature her ſelfe muſt needs have taught; and God being the Author of Nature, her voice is but his inſtrument: By her from him we receive, whatſoever in ſuch ſort we learne.</p>
                     <p>When therefore we ſay, that the Law of a Nation ought to be conformable to Reaſon, we mean and intend ſuch Reaſon, as other Nations and Men doe generally by the inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the meanes of good Literature, and their inſight in Civil affaires, underſtand and agree to be reaſon in ſuch matters. <hi>Non enim licet naturale univerſaleque hominum judicîum falſum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numque exiſtimare:</hi> It is not fitting to queſtion that which is generally allowed by all men. And that Law that approches and comes neareſt to ſuch common and univerſall reaſon, is the trueſt and perfecteſt Law of all other, and makes the people moſt happy and quiet that live under it.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, ſince this is a bleſſing that every Nation does not enjoy, froward &amp; perverſe men muſt not take an occaſion from hence, to deſpiſe and quarrel with their own Laws, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that they are irrationall. <hi>Cognitio de bone &amp; malo non pertinet ad ſingulos: omne judicium in civitate eſt illius qui glae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium belli &amp; gladium juſtitiae gerit. Regulae boni &amp; mali, juſti &amp; injuſti, honeſti &amp; inhoneſti, ſunt leges civiles; ideoque quod Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator praeceperit, id pro bono, qnod vetuerit, id pro malo haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt.</hi> To judge what is good, and what is evill in a common ſociety, belongs not to any, that are under rule; but to him or them ſolely, in whom the Supreme Power reſteth: The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115997:24"/>of good and evill, juſt and unjuſt, honeſt and diſhoneſt, are ſingly the Lawes of every State. Therefore what the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver does preſcribe, with ſubjects muſt paſſe for good; and what he forbids, they muſt look upon as evill, till he thinks fitting to order and declare otherwiſe: Inſomuch as neither the Judges nor Magiſtrates themſelves can diſpute or Judge thereof. <hi>In temporal bus legibus, quanquam de his homines judicent, cùm cas inſtituunt; tamen cùm fuerint inſtitutae &amp; firmatae, non lice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit judici de ipſis judicare, ſed ſecundum ipſas,</hi> ſayes S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as he is cited by the Canon Law<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. <hi>3.</hi> Diſt. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note>: In temporall Lawes, though they may be debated by any man whileſt they are in making, yet when they are once agreed on, and fully paſſed, the Judge ſhall judge by them, but of them he ought not to judge.</p>
                     <p>In preſſing then that a Law ought to be agreeable to right reaſon, the argument is directed to the Law-giver, not to the Subject; and the ſcope of it is to ſhew, rather what a Law ought to be, then to quarrell with any particular Law, becauſe it is not ſo rationall as it ſhould be, and as other Lawes are. But withall, it profeſſedly aymes to diſcover the ſtrange weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe, that when other Nations hold faſt the <hi>Roman Civil Law,</hi> as being the ſumme and ſubſtance of all humane reaſon, they are willing to forgo it quite, when they have had the conjunction and aſſiſtance thereof ſo long in this Nation, and may with ſo much eaſe and advantage keep it ſtill.

                     <argument>
                        <p>That Reaſon is not ſo strictly required in the Law that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the affaires of State, as in that that ſettles the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that ariſe between Man and Man.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF then we would know, when reaſon ought to manifeſt it ſelfe in a Law, and when it is not ſo ſtrictly required, but that ſome deviation may be permitted, we muſt obſerve a wide difference between the publick affaires of State, and thoſe of the Subjects own in their private dealings and controverſies with one another; for although all the affaires of a Nation both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private, muſt be under the proviſion and rule of the Law, yet is it not neceſſary, that they ſhould both be regulated in one and the ſame manner, nor by one and the ſame reaſon; for there is a Reaſon of State, as well as a Reaſon of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>In the Laws for publick matters, becauſe they reſpect the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and preſervation of the whole ſociety meerly, and ſo are not to be tyed to the ſame rules every where, a ſtrict adherence to naturall Equity and common Reaſon is not required: Safety and convenience is Reaſon enough to juſtifie them; ſo they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Vertue, puniſh Vice, maintain Trade and Induſtry, and uphold Religion. Yet it is the happieſt, when there is the leaſt aberration from common Equity and known Reaſon, even in thoſe things wherein the whole Common-wealth is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally concerned.</p>
                     <p>But it is to be conſidered, that there are ſuch multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuch difference of degrees, qualities and conditions, and ſuch perverſity of Wills, Humours, and Affections in every Common-wealth, that no humane Wit is able by ſweet equitable wayes, to reduce them to that perfect temperature and harmony, which is requiſite for the conſervation of civil unity. This may partly be judged by the government of a Family, be it great or little, which is many times turn'd upſide down, and diſſolved by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115997:25"/>the perverſe humour of ſome one or two, not corrigible by any wholſome Counſel, or moderate Chaſtiſement of the head of it. What marvell is it then, if in whole Kingdomes and Common-wealths, amongſt ſo many thouſands of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of different humours, there are many ſo exorbitant and turbulent, that no Wit nor power of Man can be able fairely to tame or temper them?</p>
                     <p>The Lawes therefore muſt be fitted to all ſuch publick acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, providing ſharp remedies for Diſeaſes that are acute and deſperate: neither muſt they tender the private right or ſafety of a few, if their detriment or miſchiefe may ſecure the whole. In theſe caſes, <hi>Legum convenientiam &amp; aptitudinem ſemper expetimus, non ſemper aequitatem:</hi> The extremities of a Nation muſt be provided for by fitting and convenient meanes, though the exactneſſe of Right and Juſtice ſeems to be infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for herein the Common wealth is like unto a Ship in a ſtorm at Sea, where the Maſter may caſt over board what private mans goods he will, to lighten the Ship, and to preſerve the whole: So where an enemy with an Hoſtile intent is coming againſt a great City, the City may demoliſh or ſet on fire the Suburbs, rather then permit the enemy to harbour there, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to annoy and endanger the whole City. The like muſt the eſtabliſhments of Law be, that are directed to a publick end, they muſt aime to procure the common welfare, without any reſpect to private right, or imaginary reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But in ſuch Lawes as are purpoſely made to defend every mans private intereſt, and to pacifie contentions and quarrels ariſing thereupon, and where the publick is not concerned, it not onely may but ought to be otherwiſe. They muſt hold forth Nature, Equity, Reaſon and a ſound judgement, ſo as to command every judicious mans aſſent and approbation; and even they that are caſt may not complain, murmure, or diſpute the ſame. And in the ſame manner has <hi>Weſenbeck</hi> in his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratitles</hi> upon the <hi>Digeſts,</hi>

                     <p>ANd here I am not unmindfull, that beſides written Lawes and conſtitutions, there are belonging to every Nation, Cuſtomes and uſages unwritten, which have as great an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling power upon the perſons and rights of the people, after they have been generally allowed, and that their obſervation hath been conſtant and un-interrupted for a long time together: And therefore ſayes <hi>Modeſtinus,</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Where Law or Cuſtome is wanting, to judge by Preſident or Example, has no defence in Reaſon.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd ſince Right reaſon is ſo eſſential to that which comes to arbitrate and judge of our Lives, Livelyhoods, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, we muſt crave leave to diſallow of their opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, who when they have neither Law nor Cuſtome of their own countrey, to guide their judgements by in any caſe that comes before them, do not reſort to the Civil Law, as other Nations commonly do, but do uſually ſupply that defect by preſidents, thinking that any caſe which the Law has not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in, may be judged by a Judgement had in the like caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which certainly cannot be defended by any right reaſon, or good judgement.<note n="a" place="margin">Si dixcrit ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, ſi vidi, ſic audivt; en dcciſiones; magis riſum quam fidem noſtram excitat. <hi>Maeſtert.

                        </note> For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the conformity of one ſentence to another, to rational and wiſe men argues nothing as to right or equity, but concludes a concurrency in opinion onely, both which may be erroneous and miſtaken.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as in judged caſes, taken meerly as ſuch, there is want of reaſon to perſwade, ſo there is want of authority alſo to oblige; for what force or power can the judgements or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of any predeceſſors have to bind or limit thoſe that ſhall ſucceed them in the ſame Judicatory? <hi>Par in parem non habet imperium, nec aliquis in ſeipſum;</hi> Judges of equall power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exerciſe any rule over one another, nor indeed can any one tye up ones own ſelf.<note n="b" place="margin">

                           </gap>ble <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thofr. ibid.</note> And therefore as it happens often, that <hi>de eadem reſaepe alius aliud decreverit aut judicaverit;</hi> upon the ſame fact one Judge judges one way, and another another: So it is to be ſeen too, that <hi>illi aliàs aliud iiſdem de rebus &amp; ſentiunt &amp; judicant,</hi> the very ſame men do determine the ſame fact at divers times diverſly, ſayes <hi>Erodius</hi>

                        </note>. For indeed the judgements
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115997:27"/>of Men may wax perfecter by age, ſtudy, and experience, than they were when they gave their firſt judgement: And thoſe that do ſucceed, may be by many degrees more eminent in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Reaſon, Knowledge, and Eperience, than thoſe that ſate in the ſame Tribunals before them; for there is in this world an undoubted wheeling in all things; Knowledge, Wit, and Underſtanding does not ſhine and proſper ſo in ſome times, as in other ſucceeding times they do; and time to poſterity may diſcover that to be an errour, which our Anceſtors thought a truth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there muſt needs be little value and weight laid upon foregoing Judgements, even of the higheſt and moſt exemplary tribunals of men; nor can they be eſteemed ſuch fit patterns for our imitation, when it is conſidered what uncertainties they lye under, what failings they are ſubject to, and what arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſubtilties, inventions, practiſes, and other undue means are too too frequently uſed to corrupt and poyſon them. For,</p>
                     <p>Sometimes <hi>pars major vincit meliorem,</hi> the greater part weighs down the better. Where many Judges are to pronounce Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſome one or two of them be eminently qualified above all the reſt, that which the greater number concurs in onely, muſt prevail and take effect; but if the wiſeſt be diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>numero potius quam ſcientia judicatur,</hi> there is more of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than of weight or knowledge in ſuch a ſentence.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he, in whoſe favour ſentence is given, carries it but by one vote more than he againſt whom it paſſeth.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes ſome one of the Judges being more renowned, or happily more eloquent than his fellowes, does either through his greatneſſe, ſpeech, dexterity, or wit, draw all the reſt into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by his too powerful interpoſing.</p>
                     <p>But the danger of paſſing wrong and erroneous judgement is greater, where the office and power of judging reſts in one ſingle perſon only, ſince it is eaſier to draw away and overcome one than many. And although it is his office to ſet before his eyes Law, Religion, Equity, and Truth, and remove far from him arbitrary &amp; licentious Wil, Love, Hatred, Envy, Fear, Indulgence, Covetouſneſſe, &amp; all inordinate Affections whatſoever; yet here too, ſayes <hi>Quintilian, Pecunia quo<expan>

                     <p>It is too common alſo, that the wrong cauſe is follow'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt diligence, ſtrengthened with the patronage of the moſt &amp; the beſt advocates, &amp; ſome of them happily too nearly related to the Judge himſelf, and aſſiſted with all other advantages, that can make Victory hopeful, when Right is deſtitue of all aſſiſtances, and but weakly and faintly defended: the one ſide too bold and preſſing, the other too too modeſt and baſhful, ſhewing a kind of guilt in bluſhes.

Contrariwiſe, let any principall thing, as the Sun, the Moon, any one of the Heavens or Elements, but once ceaſe, or faile, or ſwerve, and who doth not eaſily conceive, that the ſequell thereof would be ruine both to it ſelfe, and whatſoever dependeth on it?</p>
                     <p>As therefore the obedience of other Creatures unto the Law of Nature is the ſtay of the whole World, ſo nothing is more effectuall to the upholding of any communion amongſt men, then to command the peoples obedience to nothing more, then what Nature and Reaſon prompts them to, and to determine their Rights by Rules, which themſelves cannot gainſay; for when the judgements of a people are ſatisfied in the Reaſon and Juſtice of that which is commanded, either by their own underſtandings, or as they are taught by more knowing men; they ſit down in a quiet and contented ſubmiſſion, and looking upon their Governors with the greateſt Reverence and Honor, they obey without complaining, and thereby the publick peace is alſo ſecured.</p>

                     <p>But when the Lawes of a Nation, that ſhould be moſt clear and rationall, are wrapt up in a ſtrange language, delivered in termes moſt intricate, and the matter thereof not intelligible by any degree of true Reaſon or Learning; the people are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently poſſeſt with a jealouſie, that their deareſt rights and moſt pretious intereſts may miſcarry under them, and their ſureſt poſſeſſions ſnatcht from them, under pretence of a Law which they cannot diſcerne any Juſtice or Reaſon in; till at laſt they fall into open rage and diſtemper, thereby diſturbing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace, and oft-times ſhaking the very Government it ſelfe in their fury<note n="a" place="margin">Legum at Ma giſtratuum con temptum ſequun tue populi ſediti oſae voces, &amp; adve, ſus priu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes ipſos conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationes ac defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones. <hi>Bodin. de rep. l. 3. c. 1.</hi>
                        </note>: for there is no bondage like to the ſlavery of the Judgement, and the captivity of the Will; neither is there any greater occaſion or ground of fear, then when a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to tread ſuch ſteps, where his underſtanding cannot guide him. But eſpecially for ones fortune or perſonall ſafety to be expoſed to danger in ſuch unknown and undiſcernable wayes, it muſt needs draw on a greater diſtemper in the minde, becauſe of the great conſequence thereon depending. Moreover, when the dictates and proceedings of Law are rationall, we are much aſſiſted by our Reaſon in a conformity and obedience to them, even when we doe not exactly know the Law it ſelfe and we doe not ſo ſoon ſlip into danger or miſchiefe under it, when we have an inward guide to direct us in the way we are to walk in: but when we are to walk in a path we know not in any kind, and to obſerve rules which we cannot underſtand, it is then that we wander out of one Labyrinth into another, till miſchieſe and the penalty of the Law ſurprizeth us una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Lawes that carry in them honeſt, rationall, and clear principles, are as ſo many leſſons for the people to faſhion their lives and actions by, whoſe nature and manners will be much tempered by the diſcipline of the Law they live under; for ſince it is the onely guard and ſecurity that they have for their lives and fortunes, they will be ſtudious in it, inquiſitive after it, and attentive to it; and ſo whilſt they ſtudy and learne the Law, to keep themſelves and their eſtates in ſafety, at the ſame time they alſo learn all the duties of a Morall life, and ſuck in the trueſt principles of practicall integrity, and civill conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.

Of the which, the Nations of Chriſtendome for theſe many hundreds of years, have therefore very plentifully partaken, becauſe they have admitted into their Schools and Academies the Study, and into their Tribunalls the uſe and practice of the <hi>Roman Civil Law:</hi> for although all publick buſineſſe, and the generall affaires of State wherein the intereſt of the common welfare lyes, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by Laws of each Countreys own making, fitted to time, place, perſons, occaſion, and accidents that doe happen, which the <hi>Civil Law</hi> cannot be made to ſerve nor ſuit withall; ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious each Nations exigencies and occaſions are: Yet they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their greateſt, if not all their light and direction from the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> in ſetling the contentious bufineſſe<note n="a" place="margin">Omnia judicia aut diſtrabenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum controverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum, aut puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endorum maleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum cauſa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perta ſunt. <hi>Cie. pro Caecin.</hi>
                        </note> of the Subject, and the matters that ariſe in difference betwixt party and party;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115997:34"/>their perfecteſt Municipall Lawes, having contributed ſo little towards their determination, that in compariſon of what they have made no proviſion at all in, that which they have ſeemed to provide for, is to be accounted nothing.</p>
                     <p>Moſt States employ their conſideration moſt upon the publick welfare, and upon ſuch intereſts as have an univerſall effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole body, as eaſieſt to be ſeen, and requiring but one and the ſame remedy for all. But in a numerous multitude, and where their tranſactions and dealings with one another are ſo various, and indeed by different circumſtances become infinite; to ſuit each perſons caſe and buſineſſe with a proper and fitting rule to decide it, is a work ſo void of end or bottome, and paſt finiſhing, that no State will ſet upon the enterprize to begin it; eſpecially when the Art and Science of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> has done it to their hands ſo excellently well, and with ſo much wiſdome, pure reaſon, and true naturall equity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> (who through the largeneſſe of their Empire, and the long continuance of it, had dealings with the greateſt part of the World then inhabited and found out, and ſo had beyond other Nations, the greateſt opportunity to ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull variety of queſtions and controverſies, that fall out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man in their mutuall tranſactions, when ſuch a numberleſſe number of them came before their own Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) they chiefly minded the regulation of ſuch matters; the Lawes that are now extant, being almoſt wholly taken up in them, and handling the publick very ſparingly; for of the fifty books of the Digeſts, nine and forty do almoſt wholly conſiſt of theſe private controverſiall things. They have taken up likewiſe all the Code, ſaving a little of the firſt book of it, &amp; the three laſt Books of all. The Inſtitutes are altogether ſpent herein, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that one Title <hi>De public is Judiciis,</hi> which is the laſt of all.</p>
                     <p>Hereof <hi>Cujacius</hi> and <hi>Duarenus</hi> render this reaſon: <hi>Ideo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectum eſt jus publicum,</hi> ſay they, <hi>quod parum videretur ejus cognitie ſingulis eſſe neceſſaria, quòd de rebus privatis frequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores eſſent lites, quodque rarò de jure publico interrogaretur:</hi> Therefore by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws ſo little was declared concerning the publick, becauſe the knowledge of ſuch matters was ſo little
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115997:34"/>neceſſary for private men, and for that moſt ſuits were brought for differences betwixt one ſubject and another, as alſo becauſe little advice was asked upon that which concerned the generall welfare.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing therefore upon which a Controverſie may be raiſed in our dealings with one another in this life, but to caſt the right where it ought to go, there may be found out in the ſtudy of the Civil Law, that, which though it was a Law to the Romans only, yet has it the force of profound, pure, ſolid reaſon to all other men; ſo perfect, abſolute, and ſo rational a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme is it of all humane affaires and dealings whatſoever. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we able to prize or eſteeme the ſingular benefit that hath grown unto the world by the Roman Civil Law, being ſtill extant, as the value thereof deſerveth.</p>
                     <p>For the precepts of Nature, and the rules of Natural Reaſon, whereof it aboundeth, are either ſuch as we of our ſelves could not eaſily have found out, and then the benefit is not ſmall to have them readily ſet down to our hands; or if they be ſo clear and manifeſt, that no man indued with reaſon can eaſily be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them, yet the Law as it were borrowing them from the ſchool of Nature, to prove other things leſſe manifeſt, and to induce a neceſſary conſequence of ſomething which were in it ſelf more hard and dark, unleſſe it ſhould in ſuch ſort be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the very applying of them unto caſes particular, is not without moſt ſingular uſe and profit many wayes for mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, be they plain of themſelves or obſcure, the evidence of ſo renowned a Law added unto the natural aſſent of reaſon concerning the certainty of them, doth not a little authorize and confirm the ſame. Wherefore in as much as our actions are converſant about things beſet with many circumſtances, which cauſe men of ſundry wits to be alſo of ſundry judgments concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which ought to be done, beneficial it cannot but ſeem, that the rule of Civil Law has herein helped our infirmity, whereby we do ſo well underſtand what is right and juſt, and what otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Though the firſt principles of the Law of Nature are eaſie, and diſcerned generally by all men, yet concerning the duty which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115997:35"/>Natures law doth require at the hands of men in a number of things particular, ſo far hath the natural underſtanding even of ſundry whole Nations been darkned, that they have not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, no not groſſe injuſtice and injury to be ſo. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth how much we are bound to admire the profound wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and even honour the memory of the Roman Lawgivers, who have delivered ſuch a Law to the world; a Law wherein ſo many things are laid open, cleare, and manifeſt as a light which otherwiſe might have been buried in darkneſſe, not without the hazard, or rather not with the hazard, but with the certain loſſe of the rights of many men and nations.</p>
                     <p>For albert there is in the Civil Law, as there is and muſt be in all Lawes whatſoever, a very great intermixture of ſuch things as are eſtabliſhed by the voluntary determination, and proceed from the meere will and pleaſure of thoſe that have ordained them, who might limit Times, Places, Forms, Actions, Rewards, puniſhments; &amp; difference Perſons, &amp; might order and diſpoſe of all Circumſtances in what way and manner they pleaſed, as the Nature, Manners, Government, and Occaſions of the Roman people moſt required, without any reſpect to common and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Reaſon, and are therefore neither obligatory nor uſefull to any other State or Nation, as they were to the Roman: yet there is in it a rational and natural part alſo, which belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men as men, or to men as they live in politick ſociety, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of ſuch common and natural notions, and ſo abſtracted from ſuch circumſtances which ſhould change and alter it, that it is alwayes permanent, alike known to all men, or at leaſt to the wiſer ſort of men, obligatory, and uſeful every where. And never was there any Humane Law that abounded ſo much with this, as the Civil Law doth, it being to be found every where about the whole Law, though intermixed with that which is meerely poſitive, proper and uſefull for that State and none elſe, or at leaſt not fitting to be made a Rule for all people.</p>
                     <p>By Natural and Rational I underſtand that which our own natural underſtanding allowes as good, or diſallowes as evil, though there were no Law to forbid the one, or to preſcribe the other. And this was the ſame, which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> expreſſes to be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115997:35"/>the guide of the Gentiles, that is, of all men naturally. <hi>The Gentiles which have not the Law, doe by nature the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law;</hi> which ſhews the work of the Law written in their hearts. Alſo that which is commonly received and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by all men: <hi>In re conſenſio omnium gentium lex naturae pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanda eſt;</hi>

                        </note> what all Nations agree on is to be eſteemed natural. <hi>Quod mundus probat, non audeo improbare,</hi> ſayes <hi>Baldus,</hi>

                        </note> I dare not queſtion that which is generally allowed of.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe I account that natural and rational which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and behoofefull for thoſe that lead their lives in any well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered ſtate of government, and without which we take away all poſſibility of a ſociable life in the world.</p>
                     <p>Further, that juſtice may well be eſteemed natural and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which is ſquired by and accommodated to the nature of the thing in queſtion, as it is defined, and as it generally paſſes in the account of all, or at leaſt the moſt knowing men.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I account that only to be natural &amp; rational which was ſo when the firſt foundations of the world were laid, &amp; man became inhabitant thereof; for then all things were common, and men were not gathered into civil ſocieties; neither was there any diſtinction of Nations, nor any Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracts, no waging War, nor leading Captive, nor ſervitudes, nor conjunction of Dwellings, nor any limits ſet to the property of each Man &amp; Nation, as we ſee at this day. Therefore that muſt be looked upon as natural and rational, which ſuits with the preſent ſtate of affairs, as they now ſtand in the world at this time: for though the Natural Law be alwaes the ſame, yet ſome parts of it are primely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, others by ſuppoſition and accident, and both are of the ſame neceſſity, that is, equally neceſſary in the ſeveral caſes. Thus, to obey a King is as neceſſary and naturally reaſonable as to obey a Father, though the firſt Governour of all; that is, ſuppoſing there be a King, as it is certain naturally a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but a Father muſt be ſuppoſed. If it be made neceſſary that I promiſe, it is alſo neceſſary that I perform it; for elſe I ſhall return to that inconvenience which I ſought to avoid, when I made the promiſe: And though the inſtance be very fat removed from the firſt neceſſities and accidents of our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115997:36"/>prime being and production; yet the reaſon ſtill purſues us, and natural reaſon reaches out to the very laſt minutes, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the moſt remote particulars of our well being.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, beſides the natural and rational part before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, which either ſimply concerneth men as men, or which belongeth unto them as they are men linked with others in ſome form of politick ſociety; there is another ſort thereof, which ſerves to order and direct all ſuch ſeveral bodies politick, ſo far forth as one of them hath publick co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce with another: for although civil ſociety doth more content the nature of man than any private kind of ſolitary living, becauſe in ſociety this good of mutual participation is ſo much larger than otherwiſe: yet we are not ſatisfied herewith, but we covet (if it might be) to have a kinde of ſociety and fellowſhip with all mankind. And therefore <hi>Themiſtius</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Roman Emperour,</hi> he told him,<note n="d" place="margin">Grot.

And ſurely God in his wiſe diſpoſal of all things here below, would therefore not ſuffer any one part of the earth to be enriched with all his worldly benefits and bleſſings, but choſe rather to ſprinkle them up and down, making one nation to abound with one thing, another with another, but none to poſſeſs all things; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſeveral ſocieties of men ſtanding in need of one another, might be driven to ſeek &amp; preſerve one anothers friendſhip and correſpondence, if it were but to purchaſe theſe outward tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, and to gain thoſe great advantages which are to be had onely in a combined multitude, and for which a ſingle Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too weak and impotent. <hi>Nulla eſt tam valida civitas,</hi> ſayes <hi>Grotius,</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115997:36"/>other be put to implore the aid of other Nations, either in the way of trade, to put off their own commodities in exchange for others, or elſe to ſecure themſelves againſt a collected force that is about to invade them. Hence we often ſee, even mighty Princes and people ſo ſtrongly ſollicit to be in league with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther States.</p>
                     <p>This naturall inclination that is in the men of the World, to have the knowledge of, and acquaintance and friendſhip each with other, how farre diſtant ſoever they be, did appear ſo much in <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he profeſſed himſelfe a Citizen, not of this or that Common-wealth, but of the World. And an effect of that very naturall deſire in us (a manifeſt token that we wiſh after a ſort an univerſall fellowſhip with all men) ſhewes it ſelfe by the wonderfull delight men have, ſome to viſit forreigne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, ſome to diſcover Nations not heard of in former ages; we all, to know the affaires and dealings of other people, yea to be in league of amity with them, and this not onely for traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique ſake, or to the end that when many are Confoederated, each may make the other more ſtrong; but for ſuch cauſe alſo as moved the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> to viſit <hi>Solomon;</hi> and in a word, becauſe Nature doth preſume, that how many men there are in the World, ſo many Gods as it were there are, or at leaſtwiſe ſuch they ſhould be towards Men. Further, this converſing with forreigne States gets us an opportunity to diſcerne their inclinations, know their ſtrength and riches, or find their weakneſſe, and ſometimes to diſcover their ſecret machinations againſt our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thus whilſt we travaile and ſend out into other Nations, in purſuit of our ſeverall ends and intereſts, we fall at length to contract, exchange, tranſport, and ſo by degrees eſtabliſh a fixed trade for return of commodities each to other. This draws on firme leagues of amity and friendſhip, capitulations to fight againſt our common enemies, and mutually to defend our ſelves. And this cannot be tranſacted without the help of Embaſſies, and the mediation of Miniſters, by whom the mindes of both are made known, and our agreements ſealed and confirmed. Sometimes injury is done by our neighbour Nations, or their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, either in ſtaying our Ships, ſeizing our goods, reſtraining
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115997:37"/>our perſons, or protecting the publick and declared enemies of the Nation, which cauſeth us to demand redreſſe and reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which if it be denyed or delayed us, if the offence comes from particular men, we right our ſelves upon ſome ſubjects onely by way of reprizall; if from the State it ſelfe, or the moſt conſiderable part thereof, then followes the denouncing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Warre, and all the concomitants thereof. Beſides, when diſturbances at home are outragious, and over-violent, we are ſometimes driven to call in forrreign fores to appeaſe them.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if there be any Nation that grows ſo great in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, ſtrength, and riches, as to ſtrike terrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into all the neighbour Nations round about it, ſo as they may juſtly fear they ſhall become a prey to their luxuriant power and greatneſſe, to proclaime open Warre againſt ſuch a Nation, or to kindle the fire of diſſenſion and civil diſcord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her own bowells, or to ſet other Nations upon her back to bring her lower, and to make her incapable of offending her weak neighbours, is by many deemed a politick,<note n="a" place="margin">Principum at civitatum impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria ſtabiliora ſunt, &amp; ab inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria finitimorum tutiora, cùm ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etates ac faedera ſic contrabuntur, ut aequabilis quaedam cx om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus potentia exiſtat. <hi>Bodin. de rep. l. 5. c. 6.</hi>

How came the old Law given to the <hi>Jewes</hi> to be in ſome meaſure obligatory to the Chriſtians coming ſo long after, and to be of force ſtill, and will be as long as the World endures, but becauſe, beſides the ceremoniall and judiciall part thereof, (which was obſervable by the Jewes onely, and is now abrogated, in as much as it had but a temporary cauſe of Gods ordaining it) there was alſo a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and a Morall part incorporated in it, which all Nations and Men are bound to fulfill and keep, and can never ceaſe? <hi>Haec pars legis vivit,</hi> ſayes<note n="q" place="margin">De Legib lib: <hi>9.</hi> cap. <hi>11.</hi> nu. <hi>22.</hi>

                     <p>So and in like manner, there is in the <hi>Roman Civil Law</hi> a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiall and a poſitive part, which was a Law to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by them to be obeyed, but neither of force or uſe to others, being made for that people, climate, and government onely. But there is in it too a Law whereunto by the light of Reaſon men find themſelves bound in that they are Men; a Law by compoſition, for multitudes and politick ſocieties of Men to be guided by; a Law that may be applyed to the communion and fellowſhip of all Mankind, or divers Nations linked in amity and friendſhip together; and this part of the Law is naturall, perpetuall, belonging not to the <hi>Romans</hi> onely, but to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Men; neither can it have any cauſe of change, when that which gave it its firſt inſtitution remaineth for ever one and the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Yet as the <hi>Civil Law</hi> is <hi>Roman,</hi> it is of no validity, but as it is naturall only: for as it was <hi>Roman,</hi> it extended not beyond the bounds of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> nor did it take care for any other People or Nation but the <hi>Roman</hi> onely, nor could the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power thereof endure longer then the Empire it ſelfe laſted. But when it treats and diſcuſſes ſuch matters as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all mankind, and not onely the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation did, but all Nations and People doe ſtill deal in; as of contracts of all kindes, both at Land and at Sea, diſpoſitions teſtamentary, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cſſions in deceaſeds Eſtates where no Will is made, good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices done at anothers charge or detriment; of the relations between Father and Son, Husband and Wife, Maſter and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Governours and Governed, Magiſtrates ſupreme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate; of matters of property and poſſeſſion, injuries done to the perſons, or ſcandalls to the credit, or dammages done to the goods of Men; of ſervitudes due from Houſes or Lands to other Houſes, Lands or Perſons, Crimes and Offences of all ſorts, and the puniſhments greater or leſſer that attend them; explanation of Lawes or Statutes, or of any obſcure clauſe in any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115997:40"/>Contract, Speech or Writing whatſoever; of Cuſtomes and other publick duties payable to the Exchequer, Authorities, Powers or Commiſſions granted to others: Deeds of free gift, Writings obligatory, Inſtruments, Pattents, Charters, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges in Writing or by preſcription; Cuſtomes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions to take away or diminiſh the right and property of others: of reparations upon fraud, non-age, abſence, or other impediments unavoidable and neceſſary; Nuſances done in publick places or High-wayes, or from one Houſe to another, obſtructions in Rivers or Water-courſes, Mortgages in Law as well as Fact: of goods loſt in Ships, Taverns, Inns, or delivered to Carriers to convey to other places, or left with other Men to keep; ſervices due to the Common-wealth; patrimoniall, perſonall, and mixt, Souldiers, and the exemptions and diſcipline belonging to them: Of judiciall Tryalls in all theſe caſes and many more, where the quality of the Judge, his kind of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the manner of Tryall, the Officers aſſiſting, the kind of Evidence, the Judgement, the Execution thereof, or remedy by way of Appeale come to be conſidered: I ſay, when the conſideration of theſe ſeverall matters is as incident to all other Nations and times that live under Order and Government, as it was to the <hi>Roman,</hi> and that there be delivered and laid down in the <hi>Roman Civil Law</hi> ſuch rules and dictates as are moſt naturall, eſſentiall, and neceſſary to be obſerved in each of them; it muſt needs be, that the uſe of the <hi>Roman Civil Law</hi> in theſe particulars, as to the matter of it, can neither be locall nor temporary, neither be limited to that Empire, nor determine with it, but muſt be of uſe every where and for ſo long time as the buſineſſe to which thoſe rules are applyed, comes to be acted and dealt in, which will be as long as the World it ſelfe endures, and untill men leave to traffique and converſe with one another.</p>
                     <p>Now as in the matters before ſpecified, the difference that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes may be ſometimes between the publike and ſome private perſon, ſometimes between one private man and another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame Nation; ſo it may be alſo between a ſubject and a ſtranger, or, between ſtrangers only, or between Nation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet the ſame meaſure of juſtice will hold and ſerve for all. For look what juſtice may be rightly afforded between one
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115997:40"/>man and another upon the generall rule of naturall equity and right reaſon, the ſame may as warrantably be diſpenſed between one Nation and another, as oft as any variance happens between them.</p>
                     <p>And hence it is that all thoſe Writers that handle and treat of thoſe controverſiall things, which frequently come to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed between one Nation and another, as they are all Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſo though they doe make uſe of other authorities beſides, yet the ſtrongeſt and moſt convincing arguments that they bring to reſolve them by, are fetcht from the generall rules of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and right Reaſon ſet down in the Civil Law. And were it not for them, we had no certainty to reſt upon, nor any peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able determination could be made of ſuch controverſies, but the ſharpeſt Sword muſt be drawn out to cut the knot aſunder: For what can Hiſtories and the examples drawn from them doe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a compoſure? <hi>Errant, qui quod exemplo fit id etiam ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re fieri putant,</hi> ſayes<note n="r" place="margin">De ju. &amp; offic.

                     <p>And moreover, by as it were a generall conſent of Nations, there is an appealing to, and a reſting in the voice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Civil Law, in theſe caſes between Nation and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe any thing that is irrationall. unnatural, abſurd, partial, injuſt, immodeſt, ignoble, treacherous or unfaithfull, that Law abhorreth; and for that it is the moſt perfect image and repreſentation of Nature, and of the Equity and Reaſon Nature preſcribes to humane actions, that was ever yet preſented or ſet forth to the World in a Law.

Their judgment by water was either by appointing the party accuſed to thruſt his armes up to his elbows in ſeething hot water, or by having a cord tied about him under his armes, to be caſt into ſome river.</p>
                     <p>In theſe caſes, if the accuſed parties go over ſeven plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares laid a little diſtance one from another, and either tread
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115997:46"/>beſides them, or treading upon them with their bare feet, or taking the hot irons in their bare hands, did receive no harm: and ſo if the parties putting their armes into the hot water, were not ſcalded; or they that were caſt into a river, did ſink down into the bottom thereof until they were drawn up; they were pronounced innocent and not guilty: but if they were burnt by the hot irons, or ſcalded by the hot water, or could not ſink to the bottome of the river, or were ſlain or vanquiſhed in the combate, in ſuch caſes they were pronounced guilty.</p>
                     <p>But further, this great but moſt wholſome ſeverity of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, was tempered with a very great allay of tenderneſs and care towards the accuſed offender; as may be ſeen by the many and moſt prudent cautions that were obſerved in it. For</p>

                     <p>Secondly, it never could be had where there could be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a full and a ſufficient proof to condemn without it.

                     <p>Sixthly, The Law notwithſtanding gave ſo little credit to any confeſſion made under ſuch bitter ſufferings, becauſe it might be extored by force, and out of a hope to be rid of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pain, rather then that they were the words of truth, that it would never condemn upon any ſuch confeſſion, except the party accuſed being redeemed from his pain, and in his full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, did again confeſs the very ſame thing; nor then neither, if that which was confeſſed were more probable to be falſe then true.</p>

                     <p>In defence whereof I have therefore taken the liberty to inſiſt the longer, becauſe once at a publick ſolemn meeting, where the keeping up of this Profeſſion came to be conſidered of, I took notice that this ſmall part of the Civil Law was enforced by a worthy Gentleman, <hi>quem honoris cauſa non nomino,</hi> as a main obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, upon which he would have that whole Law to be quite laid aſide; by which rule I know not what Law there is, or ever was, that would ſtand: and for this reaſon alſo, to ſhew how wiſe and rational that Law is, even in that which thoſe that do not fully underſtand it, would ſo much condemn it for; and how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily in all other matters it may be defended, if ſo well main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in this.

                     <p>And if there be ſuch a cuſtome which I have heard is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to by ſome pariſhes within this Nation, and practiſed alſo, that when a dead corps is carried through towards ſome further place of burial, it may be ſtaied upon the way, and not ſuffered to proceed till ſome fee or toll be paid; it is ſuch a cuſtome
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115997:48"/>which the Civil Law is againſt. For that Law expreſly provides, <hi>ne corpora aut eſſa mortuorum detinerentur aut vexarentur; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve prohiberentur, quo minus via publica transferrentur, aut quò minus ſepelirentur;</hi> that the bodies and bones of the dead be not ſtaied or troubled, nor that any reſtraint be to hinder their paſſage along the high-way to and fro, or to obſtruct their burial.<note n="a" place="margin">l. <hi>38.</hi> Dig. de Mortu Infer.</note> And generally without exception either of place or perſon, ſayes directly, that no ſuch fee or toll ſhall be paid.<note n="b" place="margin">Graec.

                     <p>And ſurely if the firſt ground from whence that cuſtome came were known, we ſhould be willing for Religion ſake to lay it down. For our ſuperſtitious anceſtours believing that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the living were uſeful to the ſouls of the dead, were wont as often as they carried forth any dead body to be buried, to ſtay in every convenient Town through which they went, to receive the prayers of the devout people for the ſoul of their deceaſed Brother; In recompence whereof it is probable, that ſomething was in charity beſtowed for the poor of that place, or to ſome other end. Which at firſt proceeding from bounty, we have no cauſe to turn it into a duty, eſpecially to paſs an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity upon the dead, and when we beſtow not the prayers as they did, nor indeed can think them profitable as they applied them.</p>
                     <p>Neither is the Law ſo careful to conduct the dead quietly to their graves, as it is ſevere in puniſhing thoſe that ſhall diſturb their bodies there, or ſhall demoliſh or deface their ſepulchres. The place where the dead body lies is eſteemed Religious, and the injury done to the body it ſelf, or to the monument thereof, is accounted no leſs then ſacriledge.<note n="x" place="margin">l Co.

                     <p>If it be done riotouſly and with Armes, the crime is capital; if without, it is to be conſidered whether the body be pull'd out of the grave, and then it is capital to thoſe of the meaner ſort, but others of better rank are baniſhed, or condemned to work in the Mines.

For he brings in <hi>Cato</hi> ſpeaking to the Romans of his own time, that had much degenerated from their Anceſtors: Think not, ſaith he, that our Anceſtry brought the City into this height by armes; if it were ſo, we ſhould make it far more admirable then ever, for we have greater plenty and abundance of men, more confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, a greater ſtore alſo of armes and horſes then they had. But they had other means which we want, induſtry at home, equity abroad, freedome in conſultation, and purity of minds in all men, free from luſt and enormity: For theſe we have gotten riot and avarice, publick beggery and private wealth: riches we praiſe, and ſloth we follow: good and bad are now undiſtinguiſhed, ambition devouring all the rewards due to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Nor wonder at it, when each one patcheth up a private eſtate; when you ſerve your luſts at home, and your profit and partiality here in the Senate. This is it that laies the State open to all incurſion of others. Again, in the ſame place he ſayes of them, That they were greedy of praiſe, and bountiful of their purſes; they loved glory and wealth honeſtly gotten; Honour they dearly affected, but through virtue, offering willingly both their lives and their eſtates for renown. The zealous deſire of this one thing made them ſet aſide all other inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatſoever; and hence they deſired to keep their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try firſt in freedome, and then in Soveraignty; becauſe they ſaw how baſeneſs went with ſervitude, and glory with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.<note n="f" place="margin">Amorc primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùs libertatis, poſt etiam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The fundamentals of the Roman Civil Law were fetch'd from other States, which did then excel others moſt in Policy and Government.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe firſt grounds and foundations of the Civil Law were not of the Romans own compoſing, but were fetch'd from other Nations, and thoſe the beſt governed that were in being: for when they had caſt off Kingly government, and put themſelves into the form of a Common-wealth, they would no longer endure the Laws that their Kings had made, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not ſuffer any memory of their power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and partly becauſe the ſetting up of a new government would require neceſſarily the making alſo of new Laws, which might correſpond therewith, Therefore ſince a preſent ſupply of Laws was neceſſary (arbitrary rule being intolerable) and that to frame a body of Laws themſelves in a ſhort time, was impoſſible, and not by a new-born State to be effected; they appointed three eminent men to go to <hi>Athens,</hi> and other Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Cities which had been famous for rule and adminiſtration of juſtice above others, to fetch from thence the choiceſt Laws they could find.</p>
                     <p>At the return of thoſe three men, the Conſuls that had bore the ſway were depoſed, and both their Authority and Enſigns
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115997:60"/>given unto ten men newly elected for the government of the State, and were thence called <hi>Decemviri,</hi> whoſe office it was to ſelect the beſt of theſe Laws, and by them preciſely to rule and do juſtice to all the people. The Laws that they choſe and beſt approved of, were written at firſt in ten Tables of Braſs, to which two Tables more being added afterwards, they were all ſet up together in the open Market-place to be ſeen and read by the people, which ever after were diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Leges</hi> 12 <hi>Tabularum,</hi> The Laws of the 12 Tables.</p>
                     <p>To the direction of theſe Laws the Roman people were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and conformed themſelves for a long time, and they were the onely Law they had: Of the which <hi>Tully</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Lib. 1. De Orat.</note> gives this high teſtimony, that this one book of theſe Laws, both for uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wiſdome, did tranſcend all the books that all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of the world had written.</p>
                     <p>And although their engravement in braſs could not preſerve them from the injury of time, nor reſcue them from that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal change that altered all things in the Roman Empire; whereby it came to paſs, that ſome reliques onely of them are now extant, to the lamentation of all the learned: Yet the Hiſtorians without any diſagreeing tell us, that the riſe and beginning of all the Civil Law that we have in the books of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> came from thoſe Laws; Thus <hi>Livie, Tacitus, Sigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and <hi>Roſinus.</hi> And no leſs is delivered by <hi>Pomponius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his large Narrative of the beginning and progreſs of the Civil Law;<note n="p" place="margin">l. 2.

                     <p>And hence it is that every where throughout the Body of the Civil Law frequent and common mention is made of the Laws of the 12 Tables, and ſeveral of them entirely recited; and ſome of them confirmed and enlarged; others quite taken away; ſome of them diminiſhed onely, as to ſome circumſtances; others interpreted, as being very obſcure and doubtful; ſome declared in what caſes they ſhall be of force, and in what not: and others ſtretch'd to other caſes not provided for in expreſs words, but in preſumption thereby intended, becauſe ſo much alike to them that were expreſſed.</p>

                     <p>So that generally it may be obſerved, what Laws ſoever are written almoſt on any ſubject, are but as ſo many explanations or enlargements, made by the old primitive Lawyers, ſuch as <hi>Gaius, Scaevola, Papinian, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian, Paulus, Affrican,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Worthies, and are as it were their Comments on the Law of Nature and of Nations, and upon this Law of the 12 Tables; at firſt a forreign Law, but brought into the Roman Common-wealth by a common conſent of all the people, from ſuch Nations as for rule and government might juſtly be an example to all their neighbours.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the Sea Laws that were admitted into the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man State, and incorporated amongſt their Laws, were fetch'd from another people, namely the people of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> Iſlanders in the Carpathian Sea, bordering upon <hi>Caria</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the mighty concourſe of ſeafaring-men thither, and their continual trade and potency by Sea, grew ſo expert in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all matters and differences thereto appertaining, and their determinations therein were eſteemed ſo juſt and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that their Laws in ſuch affairs have been held oracles ever ſince. And therefore <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour to a complaint that was made unto him by <hi>Eudaemon,</hi> whoſe goods had been ſeized by ſome publick officers upon a ſhipwrack, gave him this anſwer, <hi>Ego quidem Mundi Dominus, lex autem Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: Lege id Rhodia, quae de rebus nauticis praeſcripta eſt, judicetur, quatenus ei nulla nostrarum legum adverſatur;</hi>

                     <p>And ſo in theſe Laws of ours we have what all the wiſeſt and nobleſt men in that Common-wealth (which was the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and potent that ever was in the world) could of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their wiſdome and reaſon deviſe, or could learn from other States in about a thouſand years; for about ſo many years it was from the time of the Decemvirate unto <hi>Juſtinians</hi> death. <hi>Tantae molis erat Romanas condere leges.</hi>

                     <p>From this example of the Romans, who admitted ſo freely other Laws beſides their own, and would rather ſend about to borrow Laws from others, then want ſuch as were neceſſary and convenient for themſelves, we may learn to eſteem it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhameful nor inconvenient for the people of this Nation, to give ſuch an admittance to the Roman Civil Law here, as the Romans did in their State to the Laws of other Nations: For it muſt needs draw after it much benefit, and no prejudice, if it be done with theſe cautions.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, that it be admitted meerly to ſupply the defects of our own Laws, and to have a reſolving power in ſuch caſes

                     <p>Fourthly, that it be of greateſt force in all caſes where there is greateſt need of equity and a good conſcience, whereof there is more to be found in that Law then in any other Law of Man.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, that it may order and determine all matters tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ariſing upon the Sea, or contracted and done in forreign parts, to which the Laws of the Land are moſt incongruous, and leſs ſatisfactory to thoſe whom they concern, being chiefly ſtrangers and of another Nation.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, that if at any time the uſe and exerciſe thereof ſhould be ſtretch'd beyond the bounds that are allowed it, it ſhould be penall; but be check'd by ſuch equal and indifferent Umpires, as are parties in neither of both profeſſions: For where an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochment is pretended to be made by either Law upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither ſeems to be competent enough to judge the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or to condemn the other.</p>
                     <p>Under theſe cautions, to admit the uſe of the Civil Law into this Nation, that in the doing of juſtice, where our own Laws fail, we may be ſure to be ſupplied by another, is no more then what the Romans themſelves, a renowned and wiſe people, did by the Laws of other Nations, and what other Nations do at this day by the Civil Law it ſelf, which they do practiſe and uſe as frequently as they do their own.</p>

                        <p>That time and intervenience of fatal Accidents, that has ſwept away ſo many States together with all their Laws, and has quite aboliſhed the Roman State it ſelf, has not yet been of force to aboliſh the Roman Civil Law, but that it is extant ſtill.</p>

                     <p>BEſides that this Law was at firſt derived from ſuch Nations as in their time were renowned for Policy and Wiſdome, and was a chief means to convey the Romans to their greatneſs; this alſo may be ſaid thereof that can be ſaid of no other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law beſides, That though it has been never ſeen that any Law has laſted longer then the State it ſelf for whch it was firſt ordained, but both have been buried in the ſame ſepulchre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; yet this Law is in being to this very day, after the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man State it ſelf has ſo long laine intombed in its own aſhes. <hi>Jus Juſtiniani praeſcriptum libris, non Civitatis tantùm eſt, ſed &amp; Gentium &amp; naturae; &amp; aptatum ſic eſt ad naturam univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, ut imperio extincto, ipſum jus-diu ſepultum ſurrexerit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; in omnes ſe effuderit gentes humanas.

                        </note> The Law that is ſet down in the books of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> is not the Law of one City onely, but is the Law of Nature and Nations; and is ſo throughout fitted to very Nature it ſelf, that when the Roman Empire was quite extinct, yet the Law of the Empire, after it had lain long as it were buried, ſprung up again, and ſpread it ſelf into all Nations. Therefore now it is become a ſtanding Law to Princes, although made at firſt by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> for the uſe of private men.</p>
                     <p>We know for certain, that at the firſt erecting of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals, when ſome certain kind of regiment was once approved, nothing was then further thought upon for the manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, but all permitted unto their wiſdome and diſcretion,

                     <p>Hence it has come to paſs, that the Laws of ſome certain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been more famous then the Laws of others, and the Authours mentioned with high praiſe and commendation. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> who made Laws for the Athenians, and was accounted one

                     </p>
                     <p>And yet of all theſe Laws ſo much extolled and ſpoken of amongſt the Learned, there is not one extant to this day in any entire body; I ſay, in an entire body, becauſe of the Attick Law ſome fragments may be found, which the induſtry of <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> has collected out of ſeveral Greek Authours, as <hi>Athenaeus, Plato, Plutarch, Demoſthenes,</hi> and others, where they lay diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which though they may buſie Criticks and thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template upon Antiquity, yet are of no uſe to govern a State by, nor to decide differences that ariſe in common intercourſe. As it is no ſmall wonder then, ſo does it adde much to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Roman Civil Law, that it has not been ſwept away by that common fate under which theſe and all other ancient Laws have periſhed, but is the ſole ſurviving Law at this time. The preſervation whereof is the more to be admired, if it be conſidered, how by the ſtormes and perſecutions of ſeveral ages, near it has been to be annihilated and quite ſuppreſt, as all other Laws beſides it have been. For as the affairs of State have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and as the Emperours themſelves have been vertuouſly or vitiouſly inclined, ſo has it fared with this ſtudy and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of it, and indeed after the ſame manner with all other kind of learning.</p>

                        <hi>Caligula</hi> therefore put on a more hardy but a moſt barbarous reſolution, to burn all the books of the Law that were then extant; pretending that equity would run clearer, and juſtice be quicker, where the niceties and perplexities of the Law were gone. <hi>Sed non fuit tam diuturnum ejus imperium, ut efficere potuerit quae medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabatur; nec paſſus eſt Deus rata eſſe hujus tyranni impia &amp; rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae pernicioſa conſilia;</hi> But his reign did not endure ſo long as to execute what he did intend; neither would God ſuffer the deſign of this tyrant, that was ſo deteſtable in it ſelf, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Common-wealth, to be brought to paſs, ſayes <hi>Baldwine</hi> in his <hi>Prolegomena.</hi> Notwithſtanding how odious
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115997:65"/>ſoever this intendment was, and though it proved ineffectual in <hi>Caligula,</hi> yet did <hi>Licinius</hi> the Emperour attempt to do the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame thing; but God would not ſuffer ſuch a barbarous act to be done by him neither, ſayes the ſame <hi>Baldwine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that as often as it is call'd to mind, what extremities fell upon the Lawyers in the ſufferances of their perſons, and how near the whole body of the Law it ſelf was to be ſwallowed up and at once devoured, and that from no forreign-enemy, but from the Roman Emperours themſelves, who ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected both; it muſt alſo be remembred, that thoſe Emperours were ſuch, whoſe actions are hated and abhorred by all that read them, and themſelves ſtigmatized for cruel and unnatural tyrants, and eſteemed rather Monſters then Men. Let it be conſidered alſo, that they did it to make way for their unbridled and tyrannical wills, which they thought might be more licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, when there was neither perſon nor Law left to awe them. And let it withall be ſpoken to the eternal honour of that Law, that it ſtood flouriſhing notwithſtanding, after ſo many Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had vainly attempted to throw it down.</p>
                     <p>But never was it ſo near to utter extirpation, as when a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined ſtrength of barbarous people over-ran the Weſtern part of the Empire: For we read, that in leſs time then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of eighty years, <hi>Italy</hi> though anciently the ſtrength and ſeat of that Empire) was ſeven times brought almoſt unto deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by the fire and ſword of the Barbarians, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, by <hi>Alarick</hi> King of the Gothes, who ſack'd <hi>Rome, Naples,</hi> and other places. Secondly, By <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> who razed <hi>Florence,</hi> waſted <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and not without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was diverted from the ſpoil of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the interceſſion of Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> Thirdly, by <hi>Genſerious</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> who alſo had the ſackage of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. Fourthly, by <hi>Biorgus</hi> King of the <hi>Alani,</hi> in the time of the Emperour <hi>Majoranus.</hi> Fifthly, by <hi>Odoacer</hi> King of the <hi>Heruli,</hi> who drove <hi>Augustulus</hi> the laſt Weſtern Emperour out of his eſtate, and twice in thirteen years laid the Countrey deſolate. Sixthly, by <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> called in by <hi>Zeno</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to expel <hi>Odoacer</hi> and the <hi>Heruli.</hi> And ſeventhly, by <hi>Gundebald</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> who having ranſack'd all <hi>Lombardy,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115997:65"/>home again, leaving poſſeſſion to the <hi>Gothes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when the <hi>Gothes</hi> had reigned in <hi>Italy</hi> under eight of their Kings for the ſpace of ſeventy two years, they were at laſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <hi>Narſes,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> united once more to the Empire in the time of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> But <hi>Narſes</hi> having govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Italy</hi> about ſeventeen years, and being after ſuch good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice moſt deſpitefully uſed by <hi>Sophia</hi> the wife of the Emperour <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> in revenge opened the paſſages of the Countrey to <hi>Alboinus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> then poſſeſſed of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> who coming into <hi>Italy</hi> with their Wives and Children, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves of all that Countrey which anciently was inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the <hi>Ciſalpine Galls,</hi> calling it by their own names <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobardia,</hi> now corruptly <hi>Lombardy.</hi> And afterwards in proceſs of time they grew ſo mighty and ſpreading there, that there are reckoned no leſs then twenty three Kings of that line ſucceeding one another in <hi>Italy,</hi> and their Kingdome endured no leſs then 206 years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Italy</hi> therefore being thus rent from the Roman Empire, and the Imperial ſeat being quite carried out of the Weſt, and fixed in the Eaſt at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the power thereof came to be leſs feared, and other of the Roman provinces were likewiſe aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For <hi>France,</hi> after it had been long harraſſed by the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, firſt of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> and then of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards invaded and quite poſſeſſed by the <hi>Franks;</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long hovered on the banks of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> at laſt took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the diſtractions of the Empire, and ventured over the River under the conduct of their firſt King <hi>Pharamond,</hi> and quite expelled the Romans, and laid ſuch a ſtrong foundation of government there, that they have in a conſtant and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion continued there ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spain</hi> did not long remain in ſubjection to the Romans nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out of which they were driven by the Gothes alſo, who kept the quiet poſſeſſion thereof very near three hundred years, till the Moors and Sarracens diſpoſſeſſed them; who there reigned full ſeven hundred years.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Germany,</hi> it was never wholly ſubdued by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, but what they had gained thereof, the French, <hi>Burgundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Almans,</hi> and other Dutch Nations took from them: till
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115997:66"/>in the end the French prevailing over the reſt, extended their Empire over all the modern <hi>Germany;</hi> chiefly performed by the valour of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, King of <hi>France,</hi> created Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the Weſt by the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Crowned with the Imperial Crown by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth, with whom and his ſucceſſours it remained above an hundred years; till at laſt by alienating whole countreys from it (ſome titulary acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment onely excepted) and by diſmembring it into many Principalities and inferiour States, and thoſe made abſolute and independent, that great Empire came to be nothing in effect, but <hi>magni nominis umbra,</hi> the ſhadow of a mighty body, a meer empty Title; having no reſemblance of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, from the which in the perſon of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great it was quite divided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>England</hi> alſo, that was made a perfect member of the Roman Empire, being invaded by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and the Romans being enforced to recall their Legions they had here, for the defence of <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, then waſted and deſtroyed by the Barbarous Nations, was relinquiſhed and given up, as a province that was to be held by the Romans no longer; <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> being at that time the Roman Emperour, and <hi>Victorinus</hi> the laſt governour for the Empire in the Iſle of <hi>Britain;</hi> the Romans having been in it full five hundred years, and their Laws alſo.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Roman Empire being rent in ſunder, it is eaſie to imagine, that the Roman Laws which conſtantly attended the Romans whereever they went, were alſo diſſipated in the ſame tempeſt; Laws and Government being like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins, they laugh and cry, live and die together: For Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours never think their Conqueſts perfect, till they have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the ancient Government, Laws, and Cuſtomes, and have put all into a new mould after their own way. Neither is a people throughly brought under ſubjection to their new ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, till they have utterly renounced all that was preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them by their former Rulers: Nor is the danger of their revolting quite over, till they have quite forgotten their firſt condition, and till a total change is made of Laws, Cuſtomes, Habit, and Language. And who knows
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115997:66"/>not, that it is in the power of the Sword, being well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, to impoſe what Laws and Rules it ſelf will upon a people, who after a tedious and a deſtructive war will rather embrace an ill conditioned peace, then run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a new war, where they are ſure to be ſwallowed up in ſpoil and rapine?</p>
                     <p>In this declining therefore of the Roman Empire, many Provinces thereof being poſſeſſed by ſeveral invaders, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the conquering people gave their own Laws to the conquered, but ruled moſt<note n="a" place="margin">Iuxta illud Silii; Vis coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, juriſque lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum ſibi vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. enſis.</note> by power and arbitrary will. <hi>In iis ſeculis,</hi> ſayes Dr <hi>Duck,</hi>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115997:67"/>were ſubtil, and fitted for all politick and wily practiſes: or becauſe they had a conceit, that learning did too much ſoften and enervate valour, and render men unfit for war, in the which they thought all praiſe, glory, and renown did lie; and that no where true and immortal honour was to be won, but in war onely.</p>
                     <p>Which torrent of ruine then happening, was the more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and fatal, in regard through <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Europaean</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being thus infeſted, that which is the Roman Civil Law now, and was collected and put together by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf, and doth bear his name (though ſelected out of a great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed maſs, conſiſting of near two thouſand Volumes, that had been 1400 years a laying together by ſeveral Lawyers) could not have any place then in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor could ever get entrance into thoſe parts for 500 years together after the death of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian:</hi> Becauſe this body of the Law that is now extant, was compiled and put together at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> after the Roman Emperours had removed themſelves thither, and kept out of <hi>Italy</hi> and the Weſtern part of the Empire for all that time that thoſe Barbarians were poſſeſſed of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit it is no leſs certain, that the ancient Civil Law that was in being long before <hi>Juſtinians</hi> time, and that very frame and model thereof which was drawn together and raiſed out of thoſe ancient foundations by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf, was the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and ruling Law at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and all over the Eaſt, where the Roman Empire then was, and was tranſlated into the Greek tongue for the uſe of the people, and there continued flouriſhing at that time when the Weſt would not admit it. So that it is to be noted, that when it was driven or kept out, it was by a barbarous people that followed all with fire and ſword; and that it did not ſuffer alone, but all civility and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was baniſh'd with it too: and that it was never ſo extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from off the earth, but it had a being and continuance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                     <p>And yet there was a part of <hi>Italie</hi> alſo, namely the Exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> conſiſting of ten Cities with the territories belonging to them, which the barbarous people could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, nor make them change their governours, government, or
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115997:67"/>Lawes; who being ſtill ruled by the Viceroys and Lieutenants of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan Emperours,</hi> were totally governed by the Roman Lawes alſo as they were before. And after the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Lawes made by <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was perfected and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was now to be the onely Law for the whole Empire, it was ſent to and embraced by the Exarchate of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and there practiſed, though no where elſe throughout <hi>Italie</hi> for 500 yeares together.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, it cannot be truly affirmed neither, that even thoſe parts of <hi>Italie</hi> which the Romans had quite loſt, and were made ſubject to this barbarous people, were totally guided by another Law, and had none of the Roman Law to guide them.</p>
                     <p>For, although the <hi>Gothes</hi> ruled much by Lawes of their own preſcribing, yet <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> writes, that in the time of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and ſome of his ſucceſſours, the Roman Law that had been in uſe there before, was alſo uſed ſtill, though but in a way of Subſerviency to their own.</p>

                     <p>For the time therefore that the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> were poſſeſſed of <hi>Italie,</hi> the Code of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and ſome things taken out of the <hi>Gregorian</hi> and <hi>Hermogenian</hi> Codes, and <hi>Gajus</hi> his Inſtitutions, <hi>Vlpians fragments,</hi> and the Notes and ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Paulus,</hi> all parts of the Civill Law, and antienter then that body of Lawes whereof <hi>Juſtinian</hi> was the compiler, were taken in and admitted into uſe together with their own Laws. Thoſe Provinces of <hi>France</hi> that are neareſt unto <hi>Italy,</hi> when the Gothes came to invade them, were alſo permitted to enjoy the Roman Laws upon the ſame termes; and eſpecially when
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115997:68"/>
                        <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius</hi> ſurrendred <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions was, <hi>ut lex teſtamentorum iis ſalva eſſet,</hi> that their Laws for ordaining or expounding their laſt wills ſhould not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Alarick</hi> the ſecond, one of the Gothiſh Kings, was ſo affected towards the Roman Laws, that in the year 506, he employed his own Chancellour <hi>Anianus</hi> to make a Collection out of the ſeveral parts of the Roman Laws, whereof the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſian Code was the chief, and to write Notes and Expoſitions upon it; which after he had done, it was publiſhed and ſet forth to be obſerved as Law in <hi>France.</hi> And Mr <hi>Selden</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,<note n="e" place="margin">Diſſert. ad Flet. ca. <hi>5.</hi> parag. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> that the ſame King did the like in <hi>Spain</hi> too as well as in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that albeit ruine, devaſtation, and violence had buried all that was Roman beſides; and for the better and more ſure kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of what was gotten, clean another government and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law was alſo ſetled; yet the Roman Law, either out of neceſſity, becauſe they ſaw the hearts of that people ſo ſet upon that Law, that they would never have remained quiet or peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without it, or out of ſome good eſteeme that ſuch a wilde and barbarous people bore to it themſelves, finding it to be ſo wiſe, ſolid, and rational, was ſtill retained in ſome uſe in <hi>Italy, France, Spain,</hi> and in <hi>Germany</hi> too, as the ſame Mr <hi>Selden</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, amidſt its very enemies; though much diminiſhed, corrected, and controuled by their own ſupereminent and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Law. So good a piece of policy, and ſuch a ſpecial mark of wiſdome was it then accounted, to have two Laws in the ſame Territory; the one of the Romans for private matters between man and man, for which it was ſo ſufficient, full, and equal; the other of their own, to direct and ſteer the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick upon all accidents, which they meant ſhould ſuperintend and reign in chief over and above the other.</p>
                     <p>But further, not onely the uſe, practiſe, and obſervation of the Roman Law has been in danger to be quite loſt and wholly ſet aſide, but the very books and writings of the Law have run very hard fates alſo; <hi>ut mirum ſit vel has qualeſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que juris Romani reliquias ſupereſſe,</hi> ſayes <hi>Baldwine</hi> in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legomena;</hi> that it may be admired we have ſuch parcels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115997:68"/>extant at this day. It was a moſt unhappy fate, and very worthily lamented by all learned men, that after <hi>Juſtinians</hi> compoſition of the Law was perfected and ſet forth, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that that onely ſhould be the Law of the Empire, <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſque antiquioribus quieſeentibus, nemoque audeat vel compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare eas prioribus,</hi> as <hi>Juſtinians</hi> own words are;<note n="f" place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> God.

                     <p>Queſtionleſs had they been preſerved, and tranſmitted unto poſterity entire, they would have acquainted us with much more of the Roman Antiquities then we now know; the Civil Law that we have, would have been much better underſtood, when we might have gone to the Original from whence it came; and the contradictions now contended about ſo much, would have been eaſily reconciled.</p>
                     <p>The ſenſe of this loſs did caſt <hi>Sabinus Floridus,</hi> who charges it upon <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> into ſuch an extaſie of indignation, that he ſayes, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> died mad with the conſciouſneſs and horrour of ſuppreſſing theſe books, and judges him not worthy ever to have been born. But <hi>Franciſcus Philelphus</hi> goes a ſtrain higher, plainly imprecating in this manner:

                        </q> Now though I fee not any ground to juſtifie ſo much bitterneſs, nor indeed deſervedly to make that renowned Emperour au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſuch a crime, being eſpecially thought by the moſt not guilty; yet ſince thoſe books of Law that are left us, which are but an extract from the other, are of ſuch high price and value,

                        </note> it was to be read and taught to others, and no where elſe throughout the Roman Empire; ſo it was not poſſible but the books and writings thereof muſt be loſt and deſtroyed, as indeed they were, in the direful events of thoſe Cities: For <hi>Rome</hi> was often ſpoiled, ſack'd, and laid waſte, by rude and ſavage peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who would not ſpare books or learning, that they knew would deteſt, condemn, and cenſure them, and their barbarous actions. <hi>Berytus</hi> was ſo utterly ſwallowed up in an Earthquake, that nothing of the whole City was left above ground. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperours time, in the year 478 was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly deſtroyed by fire; in which periſhed, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, an hundred and twenty thouſand books; and is ſince fallen into the power and hands of the Turks, profeſſed enemies to civility and learning, the ſame being taken by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, in the time of <hi>Conſtantine Palaeogolus</hi> the laſt of the Graecian Emperours, in the year 1452.</p>
                     <p>Thus has it fared with the very books and writings of the Civil Law; but ſuch has been the providence of the Almighty in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this neceſſary piece of learning, that neither any nor all of theſe diſaſters have been powerful enough to extinguiſh it. For although it ſeemed ſometimes to be buried, and no where viſible, yet at laſt by one means or other it was reſtored and brought to light.</p>
                     <p>But to none more is the honour of this reſtitution given, then to the Emperour <hi>Lotharius</hi> the ſecond, who undertaking a war againſt <hi>Roger</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> after he had taken by ſtorm the City of <hi>Amalphis</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> he there found the chiefeſt and moſt authentick part of the Civil Law, the Digeſts; which was from thence conveyed to <hi>Piſa,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Florence,</hi> where they have been kept with the greateſt care, and had in much veneration and eſteem;<note n="h" place="margin">Mr <hi>Selden</hi> ſayes it is there kept in the Dukes Palace, and is never brought forth but with Torch-light and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.

                     <p>Theſe books were no ſooner pull'd as it were out of the duſt, but by the ſame Emperours command, they were every where divulged, taught in Schools and Univerſities up and down the Empire, the barbarous Laws as it were ſilenced, and theſe in practiſe made the rule for all Tribunals.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the fame and reputation of them ſo ſpread, all kind of learning reviving with it at the ſame time, that in a little ſpace of time it got footing alſo with the other ſciences in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and in all the Weſtern part of <hi>Europe,</hi> where it has been in greateſt uſe and higheſt account, as well in ſtudies as in Judicatories, ever ſince to this very age of ours. Nay, the Civil Law after it was once reſtored and taken notice of, having long lain hid and concealed, drew the hearts and ſtudies of men after it in ſuch wonderful manner, and grew to that mighty eminence and power, that the moſt were intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtudy of it, and but few in compariſon lookt after any other learning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Giraldus</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> charges it as a fault upon the ſtudents of his time, and tells that one <hi>Martin</hi> a Clergy-man, did ſharply reprove the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> at a publick congregation, for devoting themſelves wholly to that ſtudy, neglecting all other learning; ſaying, <hi>quòd leges Imperiales reliqua ſcientias omnes ſuffecaverant,</hi> the Imperiall Laws had ſwallowed up all the other Sciences.</p>
                     <p>Alſo <hi>Daniel Morlaes</hi> in the ſame Century, being in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time, writes, that the Law was ſo much ſtudied in <hi>Oxford, quòd pro Titio &amp; Seio Ariſtoteles &amp; Plato penitus obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vioni traderentur;</hi> that <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Seius</hi> were minded altogether, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> were quite forgotten. And <hi>Roger Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> that had made himſelf eminent in all the ſciences, did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the Biſhops of the ſame age, for minding Divinity ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; adding, <hi>quòd cavillationes juris defaedarent Philophiam,</hi> the ſophiſtry of the Law would corrupt the true Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> took up the ſame complaint in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time, againſt the Monks of his time, <hi>qui relicto agro veri Booz, nempe ſacra Scriptura, ad alium agrum, id eſt, ſcientiam ſecularem, pro cupiditate terrena tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;</hi>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115997:70"/>who through greedineſs of filthy lucre, which was then to be gotten chiefeſt from the Law, did forſake the knowledge of the Scriptures, and hunt after ſecular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>The like lamentation was made by <hi>Robert Holcot</hi> of the order of the <hi>Praedicants</hi> in <hi>Northampton</hi>-ſhire, in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time; <hi>leges &amp; canones,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>iſtis temporibus innumerabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſunt foecundae; concipiunt divitias &amp; pariunt dignitates; ad illas confluunt quaſi tota multitudo ſcholarum his diebus:</hi> The Laws and Canons are immeaſurably profitable in theſe times; riches and honours ſpring from thence; almoſt the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Scholars reſort thither; for indeed the greateſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours in Theologie, that were, did ſo little content themſelves with that one way of advancement, that they did frequently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume degrees in Law, to fit and qualifie them for other prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo.</p>
                     <p>But ſure it is, theſe complaints and objurgations of private men could ſo little keep this luxuriant growth of the Law from ſpreading, that the very Edicts and Decrees of Princes could not bring it down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> in his Hiſtory upon the year 1254, and in the Additions, <hi>pag.</hi> 883. <hi>Edit. Noviſſ.</hi> makes mention of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution made and publiſhed by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, by which it was ordained, that no profeſſour of the Laws ſhould be promoted to any Eccleſiaſtical dignity in <hi>France, England, Scotland, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Hungarie;</hi> and that from thenceforward the Imperial Laws ſhould not be read in thoſe dominions, if the Kings and Princes ſo thought fit. Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the third for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the reading or teaching of the Civil Law in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year 1220.<note n="i" place="margin">Ca ſuper spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuta. ext. de pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileg.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe Popes thought that the reſtraint of the Imperial Law, would be a ready means to bring into requeſt the Canon Law, which was as it were but new ſet up. Upon deſign therefore to bring into credit their own Eccleſiaſtical Law, rather then out of any diſlike of the Civil, were thoſe prohibitorie Decrees made; however they very much failed of that effect that was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: for we may have obſerved to this very time, that all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115997:70"/>thoſe Chriſtian States that do acknowledge the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power, have ſo equally divided their reſpect between both thoſe Laws, that they have appointed to each their proper function; deſigning the one to be ſerviceable to Civil matters, the other to Eccleſiaſtical; and ſo by ſuch moderation have done very equal right to both. At the ſame time that the Civil Law was publickly read at <hi>Bononia</hi> by the means of <hi>Lotharius</hi> the ſecond, it was brought into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Theobald</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and being publickly read in <hi>Oxford</hi> by <hi>Vacarius,</hi> it grew ſo general a ſtudy, and other learning was ſo much neglected upon it, that King <hi>Stephen</hi> incenſed thereat, ſent forth a peremptory command, that it ſhould be read in <hi>England</hi> no more, that <hi>Vacarius</hi> ſhould forbear to teach it any further, nor that it ſhould be lawful for any to keep any books of the Roman Laws by them: <hi>Sed parùm va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit Stephani prohibitio; nam eò magis invaluit virtus legis, Deo favente, quò cam amplius nitebatur impietas ſubvertere,</hi> ſayes Mr <hi>Selden;</hi>

                        </note> But King <hi>Stephens</hi> prohibition did prevaile but little; for the power of the Law, God proſpering the ſame, waxed the more vigorous, when malice did moſt ſtrive to deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by ſending forth their Edicts forbid the Civil Law to be taught in <hi>Paris,</hi> or that any Degrees ſhould be taken in that faculty. <hi>Philip</hi> the fair, and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> anciently, did ſtraitly charge, that no man ſhould dare in any pleading to urge or cite the Roman Law againſt a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Law of the Nation. In <hi>Spaine</hi> it has been made no leſs then a capital crime, to offer or alledge the Roman Law, as compulſive or binding.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely it is a high indignity to any Prince, to have any ſorreigne Law ſet up againſt, and to beat down his own. And therefore in the erection of Univerſities in <hi>France,</hi> the Kings have alwayes declared, that their purpoſe was to have the Civil and Canon Laws in them publickly profeſſed and taught, to make uſe thereof at their diſcretion, but not that the ſubjects ſhould be any way bound thereunto, leſt they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115997:71"/>ſhould ſeem to derogate from the Laws of their own countrey, by advancing the Laws of ſtrangers.<note n="l" place="margin">Bodin. de rep. lib. <hi>1.</hi> ca. <hi>8.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like edicts &amp; declarations of Princes, have been alwayes of full force and power, as moſt juſtly they ought to be, to limit the vaſt and univerſal power of the Civil Law, and to keep it from getting above and prevailing over the Laws and Cuſtomes of their own Territories; for that were no leſs then to worſhip two Suns in one and the ſame firmament, and to call in the Roman Sovereignty, which was long ago caſt off. But that the Civil Law ſhould not be ſtudied, publickly taught, no degrees taken in it, nor cited in their Judicatories in a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial and ſubordinate way to their own municipal Laws and Cuſtomes, or that it ſhould not be admitted to teach us true equity and ſound reaſon, their reſtraining Edicts never have ſo far prevailed ſo totally to ſuppreſs it, from the time of <hi>Lothari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the ſecond, the firſt reſtorer and reeſtabliſher of it, to this preſent, which is now full 500 years. <hi>Plurimùm diſtat lex à jure,</hi> ſayes the ſame Bodine; <hi>Jus enim ſine juſſu ad id quod aequum bonumque est; lex autem a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

As a Law to bind by its own proper power and vertue, or by any authority of thoſe that made it, the Imperial Law is not admitted in any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet no Chriſtian Nation with all the expreſs decrees that that they have at any time made againſt it, has been able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it, as it containes <hi>veram naturalem rationem, optimum inter omnes leges humanas exemplum, aequitatis normam, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem prudentum, veram juſtitiae rationem, artem &amp; ſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am juris, &amp; ut bonos mores complectitur;</hi> they all admit it, as it does propound and hold forth true natural reaſon, and as it is the moſt imitable pattern amongſt all the Laws of men, the rule of equity, the voice of Sage men, the true method of juſtice, the art and knowledg of doing right, and as it comprehends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for a moral life: For thus to ſhut the door againſt it,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115997:71"/>were to renounce reaſon, equity, juſtice; and to defie all moral goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>Thus much may very well ſuffice to ſhew how the Roman Civil Law has had the ſingular honour and prerogative which no other Law has had, to be reſcued from that univerſal deluge of abolition, which hath ſwept away all other ancient Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it; and not onely to out-live <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, but to out-ſtand many dangerous aſſaults and caſualties, and divers ſharpe penal Edicts that have been made againſt it, and to continue to this very time a large and accompliſhed body. This ſurely next to the providence of God who hath ſo diſpoſed it, muſt needs be aſcribed, and the cauſe muſt needs be conceived to be, ſome eſpecial excellency and rare wiſdome that is in the Law it ſelfe; For elſe why has not other Laws continued as long, as that has done?</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>That Forreigne Nations in doing of Right between Man and Man, do mainly practiſe and make uſe of the Rules and dictates of the Civil Law.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THat the Roman Civil Law, framed ſo many hundred years ago, and deviſed for the uſe of one Nation onely, is ſtill extant and in being at this day, the ſtate it ſelf being quite extinct; poſſibly it may not ſeem commendation and praiſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, except the uſe, practiſe, and obſervation of it up and down divers great Nations of the World be alſo ſhewed. The next thing therefore that we have to ſay in further praiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that the greateſt and beſt ordered Nations, though they manage their publick occaſions and affaires of State by rules and directions of their own ordaining, having an eye to the nature of their people, way of government, and preſent exigencies onely; yet in the diſpenſation of private juſtice, and in pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the debates and differences that do ariſe between their ſubjects, where meer right and equity onely is conſiderable, they uſe and practiſe the rules and principles of the Civil Law chiefly.</p>
                     <p>Peculiar Statutes, Ordinances, Cuſtomes, and municipal Laws every State has of its own making, which in the regulation of its proper affairs it does prefer before any other Laws or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions whatſoever, though in reaſon and convenience they may ſeem much better. Yet humane occurences are ſo many in number, and in circumſtances ſo greatly differing one from the other, that no Nation is perfectly ſupplied with Laws of their own to anſwer them, but that there is ſtill need of ſome ſubſidiary Law, more univerſal and comprehenſive then its own.</p>
                     <p>And from this ground is it, that moſt States have entertained the Imperial Law, to ſupply and aſſiſt where their own is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115997:72"/>making their ſtudy and ſcience of Law to conſiſt in that, but the uſe and exerciſe thereof to be reſtrained and bounded by their own proper Laws, which every Nation requires to have firſt known, and chiefly to be obſerved. Wherefore if you tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel into their States, and ſhall aſcend up into their Courts and places of Judicature, both Judges and Advocates will be every where found to be all Civilians and Graduates in that faculty; &amp; the proceedings in cauſes there, to be moſt after the form and manner of the Civil Law. And when any caſe comes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by final ſentence, if there be any proper or peculiar Law of their own Countrey to determine it, judgment paſſes, as that ſpecial Law directeth; but if that be wanting, as commonly it is, preſently recourſe is had to the Civil Law, and by that is it both pleaded and judged.</p>
                     <p>Which becauſe it ſhews the tranſcendent excellency of this Law, being incident to no other Law beſides, and being not throughly enquired into, may ſeem incredible to many men, it is therefore a point worthy of a ſtrict examination, and fit to be fully cleared and perfectly underſtood.</p>
                     <p>For peradventure it may not paſs without a wonder, that a Prince or Common-wealth ſhould not be able to manage their rule and government by Laws of their own deviſing; or that any differences ſhould ariſe amongſt their people, which they knew not how to decide of themſelves, but muſt conſult with the oracles of other Nations.</p>
                     <p>It eclipſes, ſome may think, the Majeſty of a State, to have rules preſcrib'd to it by others. And ſince the time that a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of Kingdomes was firſt made, and each had their bounds ſet them, no Potentate, no not the Emperour himſelf has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a power to give Law to any, but to ſuch as have been his ſubjects by birth, habitation, or conqueſt. Neither can Lawes be made to regulate the whole World, or to bind all people, ſayes <hi>Suarez.</hi>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115997:73"/>too; new and ſtrange accidents do frequently ariſe, which will require new conſtitutions to ſettle them; the form of governing is divers in ſeveral times &amp; places, the Laws therfore cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be the ſame; Monarchical Laws are of no uſe to a Popular government; and Popular Laws do not fit a Monarchical State: Severe edicts will not ſuit with a milde and gentle people; and contrariwiſe, barbarous or untractable natures muſt not be dealt withall by gentleneſs or clemency. It may therefore be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, how the Civil Law that was made ſo many hundred years ago, and for one ſingle Nation, can be accomodated to other Nations, coming in ſo long a tract of time after them, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from them in habit, language, ſituation, manners, and form of govermnent.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, to hear of the general uſe of the Civil Law in forreign parts, is ſo odious and offenſive a thing to ſome humorous Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilians, that although they be ſo learned, that they muſt needs know it to be true, and having travailed abroad muſt needs have ſeen it; yet to take away all belief thereof from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Nation, leſt they ſhould look too favourably upon it, they do too frequently ſuggeſt in their writings, That in <hi>France</hi> it has been forbidden under a penalty to read the Civil Law to any publick audience, and thoſe that ſhould hear the ſame read, were alſo to undergo the ſame puniſhment; And that in <hi>Spain</hi> to cite the authority of the Civil Law in Court, has been made an offence no leſs then capital. But they do not add withall (which they know they may as truly) that theſe ſharp edicts laſted not long, but grew out of uſe very long ago; and that the Civil Law does flouriſh no where ſo much as in thoſe two great Monarchies, and ſo has done for a long time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and have both ſent forth men as famous and renowned in that profeſſion as in any other; of whom mention ſhall be made hereafter. For both the ſtudy and practice of the Civil Law has been found of ſuch abſolute uſe and neceſſity, that thoſe States that have been brought upon ſome pretence of convenience to ſuppreſs it, have been glad after ſome little want thereof to reeſtabliſh it and ſet it up again.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The general admittance and uſe of the Civil Law in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts, is acknowledg'd by our ſelves here in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Shall not travail any further to cite any more forreign teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to prove that this Law is generally received and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by other Nations; and the rather, becauſe Dr <hi>Duck</hi> in his book, has by variety of proof ſo ſufficiently made it good already. But yet it is worth the ſetting down, what ſome of our own Countrey-men have in their writings acknowledg'd to the very ſame purpoſe; and thoſe eſpecially amongſt the reſt, whoſe intereſt and high valuation which they paſs upon the Laws of their own Countrey, will not permit them to aſcribe more to the Civil Law, then the juſt truth will bear.</p>
                     <p>And it is moſt obſervable, what King <hi>James</hi> himſelf, the learnedeſt of all modern Princes, ſaid here in a Speech made to no leſs ſolemn aſſembly, then his Lords and Commons of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note n="u" place="margin">21. <hi>Martii</hi> 1609.</note> which we have extant amongſt his printed works. <q>As a King, ſaith he, I have leaſt cauſe of any man to diſlike the Common-Law; for no Law can be more favourable and advantagious for a King, and extendeth further his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, then it doth. And for a King of <hi>England</hi> to deſpiſe the the Common-Law, it is to neglect his own Crown. Yet, ſaith he, I do greatly eſteem the Civil Law, the profeſſion thereof ſerving more for general learning, and being moſt neceſſary for matters of Treaty with all forreign Nations. And I think, that if it ſhould be taken away, it would make an entry to Barbariſme in this Kingdome, and would blemiſh the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>England;</hi> for it is in a manner <hi>lex Gentium,</hi> and maintaineth entercourſe with all forreign Nations. But I onely allow it to have courſe here, according to thoſe limits of juriſdiction, which the Common-Law it ſelf doth allow it.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115997:75"/>And therefore though it be not fit for the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people here, it doth not follow it ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct; no more, then becauſe the Latin tongue is not the mother or radicall Language of any Nation in the World at this time, that therefore the Engliſh tongue ſhould onely now be learned in this Kingdome, which were to bring in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſme.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in another ſpeech in Star-chamber,<note n="x" place="margin">20 <hi>Iun.</hi> 1616.</note> printed alſo; <q>God forbid, ſaith he, the Law of Nations (intending thereby chiefly the Civil Law) ſhould be barred in this Kingdome, and that for two cauſes; one, becauſe it is a Law to ſatisfie ſtrangers, which will not hold themſelves ſo well ſatisfied with other municipal Laws; another, to ſatisfie our own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in matters of Piracy, Marriage, Wills, and things of like nature.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And again, when he was ſo mightily preſſing to have had an union of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> under the ſame policy of Laws, as they had but one and the ſame King; in a ſpeech made upon that ſubject,<note n="y" place="margin">Ult. Mart. <hi>1607.</hi>
                        </note> extant in his printed works, he told his two Houſes of Parliament, that in point of conjunction of Nations, the Civil Law ought to bear a great ſway, it being the Law of Nations. Theſe are the expreſſions of a King, the intereſt of whoſe Crown and Scepter, and the prerogatives thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing did depend upon the favour of another Law; and yet he poſitively and in down-right termes in the face of all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, avows the Civil Law to be the Law of Nations; and that all tranſactions of Treaty and of Trade with forreign Nations were diſpatched by the rule and reaſon thereof; and that the authority thereof was ſo great in the eſteem of ſtrangers, that they would reſt ſatisfied therewith, when no municipal Law could ſatisfie them. But in that he avers alſo, that when the people of <hi>England</hi> ſhall exterminate that Law, (which muſt needs be when the practice thereof is quite taken away or thruſt into a poor narrow compaſs) their honour will be obſcured, and they will be in danger to be over-run with barbariſme; it was never ſo well worth the obſerving, as at this preſent time. And it clearly ſhews, that wiſe and learned King did perfectly underſtand the true uſe of the Civil Law; for as the language
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115997:75"/>thereof muſt needs be a means to maintain learning, which does civilize &amp; ſoften the minds of men; ſo there is no ſort of learning with the which the matter of it does not correſpond and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate; but above all it does afford more and better rules for civil living and orderly converſation amongſt men, and for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealing each with other, then any other ſtudy or learning whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>But this practiſe and uſage of the Civil Law in forreign parts is yet better confirmed by the authority of thoſe, who ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and profeſſing the Law of <hi>England,</hi> have been alwayes jealous of the riſing and growth of the Civil Law in this Nation. For though they have deſired to keep it low here (for what reaſon I need not mention) yet ſome of them have freely enough owned, how much it is in uſe and practiſe in other Countreys.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> in his Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Queen, ſet before his Maximes of Law, after he had told the Queen, that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour did gloriouſly, and yet aptly call the Body of the Roman Laws, <hi>proprium &amp; ſanctiſſimum templum juſtitiae conſecratum,</hi> a true and a moſt ſacred temple conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto juſtice; he ſayes, that it is a work of great excellency indeed, as may well appear, in that <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> who have long ſince ſhaken off the yoke of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, do yet nevertheleſs continue to uſe the policy of that Law.</p>
                     <p>My Lord <hi>Elleſmere</hi> Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> was, in his ſpeech of the <hi>Postnati,</hi> does expreſly deliver, that the Civil Law is taken to be the moſt univerſal and general Law in the World.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>John Forteſcue</hi> himſelfe, Lord chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> and afterwards Lord Chancellour in King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth's dayes, in his book, wherein he does ſo highly magnifie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Laws <hi>England</hi> above the Civil Law, yet he could ſay,<note n="z" place="margin">De Laud. le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum Angliae. ca. <hi>9.</hi>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115997:76"/>or where in default of both the caſe that fell out was to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by right and ſound reaſon, or by ſome other caſes that in all circumſtances did reſemble the matter in queſtion; or laſtly, where the local ſtatutes themſelves were not ſo clear, but that they ſtood in need of interpretation, and were ſo doubtfully penn'd, that ſolid reaſon and a deep judgment was to be made uſe of to explain them. In all which caſes recourſe was had to the Law of <hi>Justinian,</hi> as to the beſt and richeſt Treaſury of legal reaſon and equitable knowledge; and which could beſt ſupply the want of a peculiar Law either with concludent reaſon, or with parallelling the caſe in queſtion with other expreſs caſes of the Law, as did exactly ſuit therewith. Much after the ſame ſort were the Rhodian Laws embraced by the ancient Romans to regulate ſuch matters as fell out at Sea, as the Laws of <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> have been in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere; when as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding neither the one nor the other have had ſuch a binding power in them, as they had when and where they were firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. And as many Univerſities at laſt were guided by that of <hi>Bononia</hi> (where learning, after it had layen a long time neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, was firſt revived) in ſetting up the teaching and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all kind of literature; ſo did alſo other Kingdomes and Common-wealths in ſome meaſure make uſe of the Civil Law, as the Empire did, reſerving to themſelves ſuch old Laws and Cuſtomes, as they had proper to their ſeveral formes and wayes of government, and the freedome of making new, which they practiſed as oft as they had occaſion. Neither, ſaith he, has that Imperial Law been at any time ſince obſerved in the Weſtern Countreys for a poſitive commanding Law, but ever under the rules and limits before ſpoken of.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115997:77"/>of the Civil Law in their Academies and in their Tribunals ſo far, as their own peculiar ſtatutes were not contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                     <p>I cannot alſo omit what Mr <hi>Selden</hi> writes in his Review upon his <hi>History of Tythes;</hi>

And as for other Chriſtian States, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no ſuperiour, or any ſubjection to the Empire, as <hi>France, Spain, Denmark, Poland,</hi> the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> and what alſo in <hi>Germany</hi> hath made it ſelf free from the Empire, though as it is Law, he will not have it to binde or rule with them; yet he ſaith, in all of them, the reaſon of it brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to method, is uſed and applied commonly to argument, when any of their cuſtomes or ſtatutes come in queſtion; becauſe the practiſers ſtudied it in the Univerſities, and had thence their degrees given them. And ſo the old Imperial Civil Law <hi>valet pro ratione, non pro inducto jure; &amp; pro ratione,</hi> onely <hi>quantum Reges, Dynaſtae, &amp; Respublicae intra poteſtatis ſuae fines valere patiuntur;</hi> that is, it is of force as Reaſon, not as an introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Law; and no farther as reaſon, then as Kings, Rulers, and Common-wealths will have it to prevaile within their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Territories.</p>
                     <p>And yet the ſame Mr <hi>Selden</hi> alſo ſaith within very few lines after, that doubtleſs cuſtome hath made ſome parts of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials to be received for Law in all places, where they have been ſtudied. And albeit he be very vehement in aſſerting, that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is adminiſtred in every State by its own peculiar Laws, yet he admits alſo, that the interpretation of thoſe Laws in moſt places, ſave <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath of late time been much
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115997:77"/>directed by the reaſon of the Imperials, and onely by the reaſon of them, and not by their authority; and that alſo in caſe where they are not oppoſite at all to the ſpecial Law of the place, but ſeem to agree with the Law of Nations or common reaſon. And he grants moreover, that ever ſince <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa</hi>'s time (which is near 500 years ago) the Civil Law has grown into a common profeſſion in this Weſterne World.</p>

                        <p>The Civilians themſelves do not enlarge the uſe and practiſe of the Civil Law in forreign parts, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Mr <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf in his writings grants it to extend.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FRom what has been cited out of Mr <hi>Selden,</hi> it does appear, that there is as much granted by Mr <hi>Selden</hi> to the Civil Law, as ever was challenged by any Civilian, or ever aſcribed to it by any, or that any can wiſh to be granted to that profeſſion in any Nation.</p>
                     <p>He in effect acknowledgeth, that when the uſe thereof came to be renewed in <hi>Europe</hi> with other learning, it was found to be ſo rich a Treaſury of reaſon, judgment, and true natural equity; and ſo uſeful for all matters that reſpected Civil ſociety and government, that by the knowledge and direction of the Civil Law, and the rules and principles thereof they knew how to ſupply with reſolution ſuch caſes, as their National Laws had not made any proviſion at all in; or if they had, but were dark or intricate, this would help to explain and illuſtrate them; which neither common reaſon nor any other humane learning would enable them to do. The Univerſities have therefore ſince made it their common ſtudy, and commonly given
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115997:78"/>degrees in it, and have ſent forth the profeſſours thereof into all Tribunals to be the minſters of right and juſtice there, till now at laſt it is grown to be a common profeſſion throughout <hi>Europe.</hi> And though the original authority which it had in the Roman State, is quite worn out, no State being now ſubject to the Roman Sovereignty; yet Mr <hi>Selden</hi> does admit it to be entertained for a binding Law by ordinance in ſome places, that ſtamp that authority upon it which of it ſelf it hath not; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers uſually obſerved as a Law by cuſtome and practiſe; but where it paſſes not for Law neither way, there the reaſon and wiſdome thereof prevailes, and every man ſuffers himſelf to be convinced thereby, <hi>non vi neceſſitatis ſed vi rationis,</hi> not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the will, as a Law does, but as by reaſon powerfully work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon, and at laſt controuling the underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Thus far goes Mr <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf; and by no Civilian has a greater latitude then this been ever given to the Civil Law. For what King <hi>James</hi> ſpake to his Parliament in the year 1609, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter; That there was no Kingdome in the World, not onely <hi>Scotland,</hi> but not <hi>France,</hi> nor <hi>Spain,</hi> nor any other Kingdome governed meerly by the Civil Law, but every one of them hath their own Municipal Laws agreeable to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, as this Kingdome hath the Common-Law; we all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly own to be true.</p>
                     <p>And what he told them of <hi>Scotland</hi> in particular, in the year 1607. may be as well and as truly ſpoken of all the States in <hi>Europe.</hi> If a man, ſaith he, plead there, that the Law of the Nation is otherwiſe, it is a bar to the Civil; and a good Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour or Preſident will oftentimes repel and put to ſilence an argument that the Lawyers bring out of the Civil Law, where they have a clear ſolution in their own Law. So as, ſaith he, the Civil Law in <hi>Scotland</hi> is admitted in no other caſes, but to ſupply ſuch caſes, wherein the Municipal Law is defective. This is generally reported by others, never queſtioned by our ſelves: For we are of opinion, there is no people in the World govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſingly by any one kind of Law whatſoever, nor indeed can be; much leſs can any State be totally governed by the Roman Law, but that there muſt needs be a ſuperadded and a peculiar Law, eſpecially as to government, ſuiting with the climate it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115997:78"/>ſelf, the nature and manners of the people, the faſhion and form of publick actions, divers accidents of the time, and ſundry other occurrences. Nay, we often ſee it fall out, that ſome certain Laws that are ſpecially made for a people, and at their firſt ordaining are found to be moſt excellent and very whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Laws; yet in proceſs of time through alteration of things, and the very perſons themſelves for which they were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, it is as great wiſdome and as neceſſary to change them and quite take them away, as it was at firſt to deviſe them. It is no wonder therefore, that divers parts of the Civil Law, that were accommodated to the nature of the Roman people onely, and the uſages then in being, ſhould prove incongruous to the men and to the affaires of this preſent world, which is of a clean different face and nature. For inſtance:</p>
                     <p>A Roman ſubject was not ſuch a ſupreme moderator amongſt his Children, nor ſuch a free diſpoſer of his own eſtate, as that he could make his Will thereof, as he pleaſed, preferring one childe, and excluding another, or parting it too unequally amongſt them, or gratifying ſome ſtranger without remembring any of them.</p>
                     <p>If therefore a childe were quite left out of his fathers Will, or were eſpecially diſinherited, but without any cauſe mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or upon ſuch a cauſe as the Law did not allow of, or if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a legal cauſe, yet not ſuch as was true in fact, the Will was void and null.<note n="e" place="margin">Weſemb. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Dig. De li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. &amp; poſthum.</note> The juſt portion or ſhare that every child might expect from his father, if he made a Will, and which he could not give from him without lawful cauſe, was, if there were but four children in all, or under, an equal ſhare in the third part of his whole ſubſtance both Land and goods; (for at Civil Law they both came under one reckoning, and went one and the ſame way without any difference) but if there were more then four children, then a full half of the whole eſtate was equally ſhared amongſt them all.<note n="f" place="margin">Novell. De trient. &amp; ſemiſſ parag. haec nos.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>If leſs was given to any child then this juſt proportion, or if it were clogg'd with any condition, or time of payment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it could not come preſently and freely to him, the Will was not abſolutely void,<note n="g" place="margin">L. omni modo.

                     <p>But in thoſe Nations and Countreys where the ſubjects are ſuch free and abſolute propietaries of all the eſtate they have, that they can diſpoſe of the ſame how they will, even from their own children, and to them in what inequality they will, theſe tender and indulgent dictates of the Civil Law are uſeleſs and unſuitable. Thoſe Titles then and conſtitutions of the Civil Law, that treat on that ſubject, <hi>Dig. &amp; Co. De lib. &amp; poſtum. haered. inſt. vel exhaered. De exhaered. Lib.

                     <p>Again, the greateſt puniſhment that the Romans inflicted upon ſimple theft, was to pay four-fold, where the thief was taken in the act it ſelf, or at leaſt ſeen and cried out upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he got out of ſight,<note n="i" place="margin">Culac lib. <hi>11.</hi> obſ. <hi>58.</hi>
                        </note> or if otherwiſe the theft was not ſo manifeſt, to pay double the value of that which he ſtole, and the reparation was made onely to the party damnified. And if there were divers perſons taken or diſcovered to be actors of one and the ſame theft, they all underwent but one and the ſame penalty amongſt them, yet either of them might be ſued for the whole.<note n="k" place="margin">L. <hi>21.</hi> parag. <hi>9.</hi> Dig. de furt.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But by the Civil Law it is not onely theft, privily to take and carry away ſomething that is anothers with an intent to defraud him of it; but it is a theft alſo, when one that has lent money upon a Pawn does employ the pawn to any private uſe of his own; or when one that is intruſted with the ſafe keeping of any thing for me, does uſe or wear it himſelf; or when one has bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed a thing of me for a certain uſe, and he does otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it, or for a certain time, and he detains it longer, or carries it whither he ſhould not, and further then he promiſed to do.<note n="l" place="margin">L.

                     <p>Howbeit, though <hi>Juſtinian</hi> will not have any theft puniſhed with the loſs of life or member,<note n="m" place="margin">Novell. <hi>134.</hi> ca. fin. verſ. pro furto autem.</note> yet he leaves High-way-men, and breakers into houſes, and pyrates at ſea, to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed by death;<note n="n" place="margin">Ca.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115997:79"/>caſe of ſimple theft it were very improper to bring into argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to cite any Text of the Civil Law <hi>De furtis,</hi> in any State or Countrey, when theft is look'd upon rather as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick crime, then as a private injury, and is puniſhed with death it ſelf, without any ſatisfaction made to the party.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe Slavery, as it was under the Romans, not well ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Chriſtian Religion (which looks upon all men alike, proceeding from one common parent, and created for one and the ſame end) is in all Chriſtian Nations worn out and aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Becauſe it ſeems to be againſt Chriſtian charity and that brotherly communion which we ſtand obliged by to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to exerciſe ſuch an abſolute dominion over any, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and religion has made our equals.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe hard and ſevere Laws of ſervitude therefore, which were in uſe amongſt the Romans, whereby ſlaves were excluded from the participation of any civil right whatſoever,<note n="p" place="margin">L. <hi>32.</hi> Dig. de reg. ju.</note> and could not ſo much as marry, nor have any eſtate of their own, nor bring any action or complaint in their own name, but as to civil communion were accounted as plainly dead;<note n="q" place="margin">L. <hi>209.</hi> Dig. de reg. jur.</note> wanting in a Chriſtian Common-wealth that ſubject matter for which they were firſt ordained, they muſt needs fail alſo of their uſe and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and be eſteemed incongruous and improper there.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like inſtances do ſhew, that the Law of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt neceſſarily be fitted to the government of it, and to the diſpoſition of the people, and ſuch affairs as they uſe to deal in; and that it is not poſſible, that the Civil Law alone without the help of a peculiar Law proper to each Nation, ſhould be ſufficient to ſteer and carry on all the affairs of every Nation, ſo differing from, and as I may ſay, directly oppoſite to the Roman. But what are a few inſtances of Laws abrogated, or out of uſe, and that ſometimes but in part neither, and which chiefly refer to publick Government, to a whole Body of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, both diſtributive, and commutative, which that Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends, and takes in?</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>No Municipal Law is ſufficient to meet with the multitude and variety of caſes and queſtions that will happen at Land, at Sea, and in forreign parts: Which has cauſed ſo many Nations to make uſe of the Civil Law, where it is proper and pertinent to their affairs, to joyn with and help their own; rather then to be without any Law at all, and to be ſubject to the miſchiefs of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarineſs, folly, and violence.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is the practiſe of the whole world to adhere and ſtand to the dictates of their own Laws, and in no caſe to admit of any other Rule, either of Civil Law, or acuteſt reaſon againſt that which their own National Laws have declared and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done.<note n="r" place="margin">Nee judicibus contra leges ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare, nec de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus in republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca probatis ac ſuſceptis dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare fas eſt. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din. de rep. lib. 1. ca. 10. in fin:</hi>
                        </note> But then it is viſible to every diſcerning eye, that the Laws that are made, are oft times drawn ſo ſhort, and put into ſuch obſcure and ambiguous termes, that it is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſome other Law or rule ſhould be found out to ſupply, clear, and explain them. And every where the body of the Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal conſtitutions appears ſo narrow and ſlender, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends ſo little, that the number of caſes that are expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by Law, is not by many degrees comparable to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, that do frequently and almoſt daily happen, wherein the Law of the Nation has not made any deciſion at all.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> in his Preface to the Iriſh Reports, does not ſtick to acknowledge this to be moſt true in the Municipal Law of <hi>England,</hi> though in his praiſes of it he ſets it above all the Laws of the World beſides. For, ſaith he, if the Rules and Maximes of the Law were a thouſand times as many as they be indeed, yet would they carry no proportion with the infinite diverſitie of mens actions, and of other accidents, which make the caſes that are to be decided by the Law. How great need is there therefore to keep the Civil Law in <hi>England</hi> ſtill, that out of its
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115997:80"/>ſtore and plenty it may be inſtrumental to reſolve thoſe doubts and queſtions of right, which as yet have no ſpecial Law of the Nation made for them?</p>
                     <p>Indeed as the humours and inclinations of men do differ, and their occaſions are divers, and the ends they purſue, various, and the way and courſe they take to obtain them, not the ſame; ſo is it impoſſible, that the actions that proceed from them, ſhould be like and uniform, but muſt needs, as their cauſes are, be various and diſagreeing: From whence it happens, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day produces ſuch accidents, as though they be not wholly new, yet they come accompanied with one circumſtance or other, that makes them differ from all that went before them. Beſides, Nature it ſelf brings forth ſome variety of contingents without any act of man.</p>
                     <p>All which being of ſeveral natures, and differently circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated from what is paſt or could be thought of, though they do too frequently happen and intermix with the affaires of men, yet to ſupply them with a direct peculiar Law, or any other expreſs and determinate rule to ſettle them, is an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that was never undertaken by the wiſeſt Law-givers that have been;<note n="s" place="margin">Legiſlator non poteſt omnia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarare, quia res in quibus verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ſunt prope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modùm infinitae; &amp; quia in hac vita mortali ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil eſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum; &amp; propter ingenii imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumus cunctae rimari.

And yet ſince there is a neceſſity of ſetling ſuch various and ſo unlike contingencies, ſome rational way or rule muſt be found out whereby to compoſe and ſettle
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115997:81"/>them, leſt they ſhould be made ſubject to meer will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or in default of better means, men intereſted therein ſhould be left to right themſelves by forcible and violent wayes.</p>
                     <p>It is no leſs evident and manifeſt, that whileſt we have to deal with forreign States, as ordinarily we do in the way of trade and commerce, and too frequently in the way of War too, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and controverſies without number do ariſe, ſome whereof do concern &amp; reflect upon the States themſelves, as being of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick concernment; others be of a more private nature, and do concern the intereſt of ſome ſubjects onely. But when ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of either kind do happen, is there any Municipal Law capable to decide them? ſhould we not as much diſdain to be judg'd by the Law of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> when we have to do with them, as they would to be over-ruled by ours, when they have to do with us? Nay, ſhould we not abandon the ſociety of ſuch a Nation, that ſhould tie us to their own Laws, in matters that are tranſacted and done out of their proper Territorie, as happily upon the open Sea, or in the Territory of another Prince and people? Of what force or power can a Law be to thoſe who are not ſubject to the authority of thoſe that make it<note n="w" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ubi ceſſat ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictio ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emium, ſtatuti diſpoſitio non obtinet.</hi> l. fin. Dig. de jutiſd. omn. Iudic. l. 1. Co.

And yet when we fall into their hands, and controverſies are moved againſt us in their Tribunals, we muſt inevitably ſtand to and abide their juſtice, and the like they owe to ours: But then right muſt be done by ſuch rules and principles, as both ſides may be fully ſatisfied in the equity of them.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore does appear the true uſe of the Civil Law, and the ground whereupon all Nations have admitted it into their Courts and acts of juſtice: For although it cannot be ſaid, that there is no caſe which is not contained in the Roman Law: <hi>Neque leges neque ſenatuſconſulta ita ſcribi poſſunt, ut omnes caſus qui quandoque inciderint, comprehendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; ſed ſufficit, &amp; ea quae plerunque accidunt, contineri,</hi> ſayes the Civil Law it ſelf:<note n="x" place="margin">
                           <hi>L. 10.</hi> Dig. De legib.</note> Neither Laws nor reſults of Council can be ſo ſufficiently framed, as to provide for all caſes that ſhall happen hereafter; but it may ſuffice, if ſuch caſes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, as in contingency are moſt familiar and common: yet ſuch is the copiouſneſs of that Law, beyond any that has yet been; and ſuch a wonderful enlargement has been made
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115997:81"/>thereof by the profeſſours of it in all ages ever ſince, as caſes and accidents of all ſorts and natures, and in all Countreys, have happened from time to time, from ſtudy, argument, and the ſeveral reſolutions of forreign Courts applied thereunto, and all upon the reaſon and equity of that Law which was written by the Romans; that now it may be juſtly thought, no caſe can fall out or accident ariſe, which the learning of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thus poliſhed and perfected, either in expreſs termes, or by parity of reaſon, will not determine. Wherefore it is upon juſt reaſon, and likewiſe upon neceſſity too, that ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have recourſe to the wiſdome and fulneſs of that Law thus amplified, as oft as their own particular conſtitutions fail them.</p>
                     <p>And although there are a ſort of men in the world (who indeed have ſome good natural abilities in them, as a ready apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a quick wit, a holding memory, and a ſmooth elocution, but were never brought up either in Law or any learning) yet they do much preſume upon that ordinary and common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they have, that they think, or at leaſt they would have the World believe ſo, whereby they may be thought worthy of the beſt places of Judicature, that they can by the ſtrength of their poor illiterate reaſon reſolve all queſtions and doubts of Law whatſoever, whether they ariſe at Land or at Sea; be they of publick concernment or of private; entrenching upon our own Law, or touching upon the Law of Nations; be the caſe between Prince and people; ſubject and ſtranger; one State and another; clear in Law or ambiguous; ſetled by expreſs conſtitution, or left undecided; yet their capacity, as they would have it conceived, without any ſuch help as the Civil Law, does ſuffice for all.</p>
                     <p>And yet when theſe preſumptuous and high conceited men do ſit to judge and adminiſter right on ſuch matters, they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find what they would not before believe, or at leaſt not have believed by others, that their underſtanding is too narrow to comprehend ſuch difficult things, and their inſufficiency to be too great to determine them: and are therefore driven to conſult with the learned of that profeſſion, to whoſe skill it does belong, not without ſome ſhame to themſelves. And it were
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115997:82"/>to be wiſhed, that the onely effect of ſuch mens ambition and confidence might reſt there, and that it did no greater miſchief. But it commonly falls out to be fatal to the intereſt of many, which is taken away or prejudiced by their errour &amp; ignorance: and ſometime States alſo are embroyled in war and hoſtility each againſt other by their unskilful managery; <hi>Ignorantia judicis plerunque eſt calamit as innocentis,</hi> ſayes St <hi>Auſtin;</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">De Civit. Dei. lib. <hi>19.</hi> ca. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note> the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Judge is frequently the woe of thoſe that are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                     <p>And indeed though it be nothing elſe but reaſon, that does render a man capable and fitting to diſcuſs and pronounce upon ſuch queſtions, yet it is not the vulgar &amp; common reaſon that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does beſtow upon every man; but it is that reaſon which is gotten by art and ſtudy of the Law and of the rules &amp; principles of juſtice, and which is improved and inlightned by a continual uſe, and a long experience, and which in truth is to be found no where but in ſtudents, practiſers and Judges of the Civil Law onely.</p>
                     <p>And yet there has been a ſtrong conceit, taken up but lately, but yet very hotly purſued, to have the ſame take effect, by folliciting the ſtate to make a Law to that purpoſe; that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of old experienced Merchants are much fitter and better enabled to ſit upon the trial and examination of matters of forreign trade and negociation, and of buſineſs ariſing upon or beyond the Sea, then any ſtudents, graduats, or practiſers in the Civil Law whatſoever; ſuppoſing, that if the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty were turned into a Court of Merchants, both ſubjects and ſtrangers would be better ſatisfied, and trade go on and thrive much better.</p>
                     <p>Which project ſome Merchants have been the more embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to ſet on foot, becauſe they once prevailed ſo far, as to get an Act of Parliament to be made in the fourty third year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereby all controverſies that ſhould from thenceforth ariſe upon any aſſurances made of any goods, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, ſhips, and things adventured, are committed to the hearing and trial of ſo many Judges, whereof the Civilians are feweſt, and the Merchants make the greateſt number. They would have it conceived, that none has underſtanding or skill
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115997:82"/>enough to judge of the my ſterie of their employment but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves onely; and that it is equity and a good conſcience, in a moſt ſummary and a compendious way, and not the intricate and long Maeanders of the Law, that is the fitteſt to arbitrate and decide their differences; crying out for a quick diſpatch, that their voyages to Sea may not be obſtructed. They are jealous withall, that the profeſſion of the Law is but a deſign to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich a company of men with the vexations and ſpoiles of others; grudging, that there ſhould be a diſtinct profeſſion made of the Law, which ſecures themſelves and all they have, when every Trade and Handicraft hath the like.</p>
                     <p>In which ſuggeſtions if there could be imagined to be any either truth or ſoundneſs, yet ſince the ſame may be made by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trades and profeſſions as well as by the Merchants; it would argue, that there were by the State too great care had of them, and too little had of others, to aſſign the Merchants onely Judges out of their own order, and not to grant the ſame privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to other Tradeſmen alſo.

                     <p>Beſides, it is moſt frequent and ordinary for a number of Merchants to joyn in copartnerſhip together, and to employ one common and joynt ſtock beyond the Seas, and yet few of the copartners known or taken notice of; ſo that it may happen, that a Merchant, that ſits on the judgment ſeat, may be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in the caſe in queſtion, and be judge in his own caſe, and yet his intereſt not ſeen or diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>Again, there is ſuch a ſpirit of oppoſition reigns between the Merchant and the Mariner, who is as uſeful and ſerviceable at ſea as the Merchant can poſſibly pretend to be, that if the Merchant ſhould ſit to judge the Mariner, in time, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poor Mariners might be ſo ſeverely dealt with, and kept with ſuch ſhort wages by the Merchant, at whoſe pleaſure and command he is, that he will not care to ſerve, and ſo naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be quite loſt.</p>
                     <p>Nay further, the controverſies in the Admiralty are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our own Merchants onely, but many times between our own and other Merchants of forreign Nations. Whereby, if ours were Judges, there would be given into their hands a great advantage to help and gratifie thoſe of their own Countrey and rank, and to oppreſs ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, what affinity is there between buying and ſelling, (which is the onely skill of the Merchant) and judging of the nature and right of contracts, injuries, debts, agreements, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and other accidents and emergencies happening upon the Sea or in forreign parts, which they ſo covet to gain unto themſelves? Which knowledge and faculty is not to be found in the depth of the Ocean, nor to be obtained by Travail, but is gotten by ſerious contemplation and a long ſtudy, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the practiſe of a mans whole life.</p>
                     <p>I write not this to debaſe the true worth nor to leſſen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Merchants. They are a people that enrich the Nation as well as themſelves; and for the dangers they run through, both perſonal and real, they deſerve to have the higheſt immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities conferred on them. But let them keep within their own ſphear, and not aſpire to ſuch a function, which neither their breeding, capacity, or parts does enable them unto, nor their employment gives them leiſure to diſcharge.<note n="d" place="margin">Robert Rer. judicat. lib. <hi>2.</hi> ca. <hi>16.</hi>
                        </note> And therefore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115997:83"/>upon a ſolemn debate, whether Merchants ſhould be joyned to Civilians to try ſuch matters, it was denied, and judg'd againſt in <hi>France,</hi> in the year 1584.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, that it ſhould be thought that men (whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law and skill to do right and juſtice is no greater, then bare nature and their illiterate education has affoorded them) ſhould be able to do it quicker, and at leſs charge to thoſe that ſeek it, then thoſe that have made it their whole ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and employment, is to me an imagination ſtrange and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond belief; for unqueſtionably the skilful and expert Judge, that by his ſtudy and practiſe is accuſtomed to ſuch buſineſs, as he does beſt underſtand it, ſo he muſt needs ſooneſt diſpatch it alſo. Becauſe cuſtome and knowledge hath made all things of that nature obvious and eaſie to him; and ſuch a judge will not allow any thing to be ſpoken impertinently and beſide the matter in queſtion; and ſo a multitude of buſineſs goes off quickeſt under him, and both delay and much charge is avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But when they come to judge thereof, who never medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated or dealt in ſuch things, it muſt needs be, that they muſt run into many impertinent queſtions, and that they muſt toyle and perplex themſelves to underſtand the true point in iſſue; meeting every where with knots and difficulties, and ſcarce any thing that is eaſie &amp; clear to them; wherby they cannot without long and frequent debates and much time ſpent reſolve any eaſe in queſtion. And though it be rightly decided in the end, which it is twenty to one if it be, and is an act of chance rather then judgment; yet in a multitude of other buſineſs, before any comes to be judg'd, the attendance, I am ſure, is moſt tedious, and the charge intollerable: ſo that to put the Maritime and forreign affairs to be judg'd by Merchants, is to augment delay and charge, rather then to leſſen either.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, thoſe that ſtudy and profeſs onely the Law of their own Countrey, (which as I ſaid before, is commonly but of narrow extent, and ſerves but for a few particular occaſions onely) may be as juſtly deemed incapable to judge and ſit upon triall of ſuch matters (though they do concern the diſpenſing of Law and juſtice too) wherein the Municipal Law is ſilent, and has made no proviſion at all; or peradventure is not capable
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115997:84"/>to make any determination in them; as when they fall out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the main and open Sea, or in a forreign State, or are contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies ariſing between two ſeveral Nations, or their ſubjects, to which no Municipal Law can be applied. In brief, where the Laws ſtand diſtinct, and the profeſſions thereof diſtinct alſo, the exerciſe of them ought not to be confounded by the ones thruſting into the others function and calling. And therefore much leſs reaſon have they to prohibit the Civilians, who have the knowledge, the triall of thoſe caſes; and aſſume it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who have it not.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon therefore we ſay it is, that though every Nation has Laws and Statutes of their own, proper for their affairs and people, and thoſe within their ſeveral confines, ſo far as they do preſcribe, have the preeminence above any other Law or reaſon in the world, as has been ſaid before: Yet there is no forreign Nation in the World, that has a diſtinct ſtudy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Municipal Law of the Nation, apart and divided from the Roman Civil Law: neither are there any where elſe ſtudents and profeſſours of any Municipal Law diſtinctly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and dignified, as there are in <hi>England.</hi> But the ſtudy and profeſſion of Law that is to be found in the other parts of the World, and is ſerviceable for the government of the Civil State, is the ſtudy and profeſsion of the Roman Civil Law onely.</p>
                     <p>All which, and whatſoever elſe we ſhall ſay hereafter to the ſame purpoſe, we would have underſtood as humble propoſals onely, to be conſidered of in order to a future ſettlement which we hope and long for. But if the Authority of this Nation (who beſt can judge what is fitteſt for the people, and what ſuits beſt with the preſent Government) ſhall in the end commit and diſpoſe of thoſe Trials which formerly did belong to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of the Civil Law, into the hands of others, that do not partake of that excellent knowledge; it does behove all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſit down ſatisfied therewith, and to ſubmit unto it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any murmuring or diſputing; for I do greatly approve of that golden ſaying of the Civil Law.<note n="e" place="margin">

                     <argument>
                        <p>The reaſons are ſtrong and weighty, upon which ſo many forreign States do direct and order the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of their Tribunals moſt by the praeſcript, reaſon, and equity of the Civil Law.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is from the Roman Civil Law that the ſtudents in forreign Nations do derive their firſt principles of Law and juſtice, and in this are all publick Lectures read and degrees taken, and not in any Municipal Law.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is true, that before they practiſe or ſit in places of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, they read and throughly inform themſelves in the Laws of their own Countrey; by which, where there is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and expreſs conſtitution in the point, their pleadings and judgments muſt be directed wholly. But in caſes where there is none, as the caſes be but few where there is, in compariſon of thoſe where there is not; or where that which is, is either in ſenſe ambiguous, or in words obſcure, and muſt be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or where no Municipal Law can be of any force or uſe at all, as in the caſes above ſpecified, there they generally make the Civil Law, or the reaſon thereof, their onely rule and guide, to adminiſter right and juſtice by both to their own people, and to forreigners alſo.</p>
                     <p>To this they are led by divers neceſſary and moſt important reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, for them to do ſo, is but anſwerable to their education, as they are all Civilians, and to thoſe principles which their learning hath ingrafted in them: For ſince they have been bred and diſciplined under it, it is no wonder if their judgments and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115997:85"/>reſults be ſteered by it: it being natural, that waters ſhould have the true reliſh of the fountain from whence they flow. And therefore when the learned of that profeſſion ſate in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Judicatories of <hi>England,</hi> diſtribution of juſtice was ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame rules in ſuch caſes, wherein no ſpecial Law was, or could be made to guide them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it cannot be deviſed, how ſuch caſes as neither the Law nor the cuſtome of the place has ſpecially provided in, can be well underſtood, and receive a true and right judgment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of that profeſſion. All other learning beſides that is taken up in the conſideration of things that are clean of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature; and does not conſider what dealings there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, ſubjects and forreigners; and what ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity does require in each of them, as that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly doth.</p>
                     <p>As for vulgar and common reaſon, it is of uſe in matters that are obvious to ſenſe, and to the firſt apprehenſion, and which are miniſterial to the maintaining of life and livelyhood. But where the diſcurſive faculty muſt be employed, and great reaſoning and a long experience is required, as in the things we now ſpeak of, ordinary reaſon, if we preſume upon it, will ſooner lead us into errour, then be any advantage towards a ſolid and right judgment. Nay, ſo unable are the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities to diſcern and judge of them, that it is uſual for the Judges of the Law themſelves to be at a ſtand, and to ſpend ſome time in ſtudy and counſel, ere they can reſolve ſome queſtions that do ariſe; ſo intricate and perplexed are they.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is the nature and practice of all States and people, beſides their own proper Laws, to uſe ſuch as are common to all other Nations and men, and ſo no ſtrange thing to cheriſh two Laws in one Common-wealth, as ſome do too vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. <hi>Omnes populi, qui legibus &amp; moribus reguntur, partim ſuo proprio, partim communi omnium hominum jure utuntur,</hi> ſayes <hi>Gaius;</hi>

Deju. nat. gent. &amp; civ.</note> All people that are guided by any Law or cuſtome at all, are guided by a Law common to others, as well as by that that is peculiar to themſelves; for if the Law of a Nation be not univerſal enough (as indeed none is) but that in the miniſtration of juſtice there will every day ariſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115997:85"/>ſuch queſtions, which the particular Law has not touch'd upon; if there be not ſome other Law to flie to, there muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſue either a failer of juſtice as to thoſe caſes, which would draw on a ſelf-revenge; or elſe the ſetling them muſt be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and at will, which a people will not long endure.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, there is no Nation in the World, that abounds with all things. There is no people ſo well fortified, but that they may ſtand in need of the aſsiſtance of others, either in matter of commerce, or to joyn in oppoſing a common enemy, who watches to deſtroy them both. When as therefore the implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this forreign help, or the tranſportation of our native commodities to thoſe that can ſupply us with theirs, which we have not, drives us to a neceſsity of dealing with other people; it is ſubſtantially needfull alſo to order ſuch dealings by, to have ſome Law or rules generally known, and unqueſtionably juſt to both.</p>
                     <p>There being therefore a neceſsity of another Law, beſides the particular Law of each Countrey, the Civil Law has been choſen by moſt forreign States, becauſe it has from the time of the Romans run through all Nations, and has been ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally applauded and allowed of by all, that now at laſt it has purchaſed to it ſelf the honour to be ſtyled, <hi>Jus Gentium,</hi> the Law of Nations, or <hi>jus commune,</hi> the common Law of all <hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe it hath more in it of the Law of Nature, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all mankind, then any other Law of Man.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Civil Law is of ſuch large extent, and ſo vaſt a comprehenſion, that nothing can fall out, wherein the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Law, equity, or any part of juſtice may be neceſſary, which either the words of that Law, or the reaſon thereof will not decide: For indeed the Romans, through the Univerſal power they had over a great part of the World, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing ſeveral wayes with the reſt, were brought acquainted with the nature and ſtate of all Humane affairs of what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, it provides not for the welfare and intereſt of one Nation onely, as a particular Law does, but contemplates and takes care for the general affairs of all people: For it treats of all manner of differences ariſing between one State and another,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115997:86"/>of the Laws of war and articles of peace, of leagues, truces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals, rights and priviledges of Embaſſadours, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of priſoners; of precedencies due to Princes; of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of trade to forreiguers, and of the reſtraint thereof upon juſt and weighty reaſons; of the free and common uſe of the Sea, and how it may be interdicted or limited; of all contracts in and about ſhipping or tranſportation; of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages or injuries done at Sea; of Cuſtomes, Wrecks, Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Salvage, or contribution; of aſſurances made upon ſhips or goods; of the carrying of Armes, Money, or Men, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or ſtrengthen our enemies; of the conditions given for the ſurrendring beſieged places, by whom they may be effectually made, and how far they may be extended; whether change of governour and government can diſſolve amity, friendſhip and reſpect between us and other States. Theſe and ſuch like are matters of concernment to other States as well as to our ſelves, and are not medled with by Municipal Laws, but fall under the learning of the Civil Law onely; whereby it muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a moſt noble and uſefull ſcience, the profit thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not confin'd to one Territory, but communicable to the whole ſociety of Men.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the precepts and rules of this Law are but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of natural reaſon, and which command the aſſent and approbation of the moſt judicious, when firſt propounded. And ſo ſatisfactory and convincing is the juſtice thereof both to ſubjects and ſtrangers of other Nations, that it ſilenceth the complaints of thoſe, who are thereby condemned, their own reaſon and conſciouſneſs concurring in that condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, it is the uſe of the Civil Law that holds up the entercourſe and correſpondence of nations each with other; for where the rules of judging controverſies, as oft as they do ariſe, are certainly known and allowed of, there any Prince or people will be ſtrongly invited to Trade, make Leagues, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marry, ſend their Embaſſadours, and communicate all other offices of love and friendſhip whatſoever: becauſe they know what dealing they ſhall have from them, and what juſtice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at their hands. But where <hi>illud juſtum eſt quod eſt utile,</hi> that is, where advantage does rather ſet the rule for juſtice then
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115997:86"/>right reaſon; or where it muſt be adminiſtred by preſcriptions of their own deviſing, which none can diſcern any equity or reaſon in, nor underſtand but themſelves, ſuch a Nation muſt make much of themſelves, and be contented to ſubſiſt of what they have of their own; for no other Prince or people will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to deal or correſpond with them.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, thoſe that are the compoſers of this Law, in the ordaining thereof had not, as is uſuall in the making of other Laws, the advantages of State in their eye, nor the honour and greatneſs of thoſe that had the government, nor any meerly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick conſiderations whatſoever; much leſſe did they look at the particular benefit of any private men. But as in publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>ſalus populi</hi> was <hi>ſuprema lex,</hi> ſo in private, <hi>quod aequum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num<expan>
                              <am>

                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> fuit,</hi> was that which made up the Law with them; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of true right and pure equity was thought the moſt effectuall means to preſerve the whole. And hence it is, that the ſincere equity of the Roman Civil Law has been owned, and the wiſdome of it greatly admired by thoſe, to whom the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the Roman State, and the intereſt of the Rulers of it could not be known.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, this Law is ſo well tempered, and ſo indifferently compoſed, that it may be accommodated to any kind or form of government; ſo that be the Supreme power in one, or be it in few, or be it in the whole people, it is equally uſeful for them all: for <hi>Rome</hi> came under all theſe ſeverall formes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſome part of the Civil Law was made under each of them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Triall, that is the true Touchſtone of Laws as of all things elſe whatſoever, has exalted it above all other Laws of Man. Firſt, in the general uſe of it every where about the World. Secondly, in the continuance of it to this preſent time, after the State and Government of <hi>Rome</hi> has long ago ceaſed to be, and againſt all ſtormes and tempeſts that have come. Thirdly, in that all States and Common-wealths have exceedingly flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that have made uſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>And yet we are not ſuch vain exalters of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as to think, or boaſt, that the Civil Law has the force or property of a Law within it, ſo as to preſcribe to or bind forreign Nations.<note n="h" place="margin">Leges non alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur in curi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115997:87"/>of its own, it commands and neceſſitates no where, and yet (as reaſon muſt alwayes prevaile with men that are rational) it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes, illuminates, and perſwades every where. We ſay this further, that though in matters of publick government the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Law bears ſway, and is practiſed altogether in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for thoſe muſt be managed by ſuch prudent wayes and means, as the ſupreme Governours from time to time ſhall think moſt neceſſary; without being tied up to any certain rules even of their own, much leſs to any of the Roman Empire: yet in private controverſial things, ariſing between man and man, ſome ſpecial matters of more publick and general concernment excepted, the Civil Law is much more practiſed and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed, then the Municipal. Becauſe in reſpect of the great variety and multitude of ſuch caſes, the Municipal Law can declare but little that is certain in them: So that though we cannot ſay, that forreign States are governed by the Civil Law, yet the ſuits and differences their ſubjects have one with another, are for the moſt part judg'd and ended by it. But the admittance of the Civil Law in theſe caſes, how general ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, is voluntary and free, without either neceſſity or conſtraint.</p>
                     <p>And we do ſo little think, that the want of a compulſive and binding power does in any part obſcure the luſtre of it, as in our judgments that very conſideration does commend it much more, and makes the merit of it much more conſpicuous and ſplendid; for to be awed by an impoſed Law, argues the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of the power that impoſes it, and the ſervility and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people that are under it, but no worth and excellency in the Law it ſelfe: for peradventure if they were left to their full freedome, they would chuſe to live under ſome more natural and more reaſonable Law. But when a Prince and people ſhall of their own accord without direction or command from any other, freely embrace a Law, and deſire to be tried and judg'd thereby (as forreign States do by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law) it is an evident token, that this free aſſuming of ſuch a Law, proceeds from ſome known ſingular vertue and rare good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in it; for elſe they would not, being at liberty, be ſo unanimouſly guided and directed by the ſame.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The admittance and ſway of the Civil Law in forreign parts, is yet further verified by the teſtimonies of Sir <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> and Dr <hi>Hakewill,</hi> the one a Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the other a famous learned Divine of our own, and by ſome other remarkable institutions within this Nation.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have before told you, what a great and renowned King of this Nation, and five great Sages of the National Law have ſaid concerning the fame and practiſe of the Civil Law in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations. I connot paſs by what Sir <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> a moſt famous Scholar and Stateſ-man of this Nation, and one who in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time went Embaſſadour to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſo had the opportunity to know more of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thoſe that ſit at home, has written <hi>obiter</hi> to the very ſame purpoſe, in his book <hi>De Republica Anglorum.</hi> Wherein after he has delineated and ſet forth the true ſtate of the policy and forme of government within this Common-wealth, and wherein the Laws thereof do greatly differ from that, which other States do obſerve and follow, in his third book, ca. 11. he cloſes in this manner. <hi>Adminiſtrationis &amp; Politiae Anglica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae formam quaſi in tabula breviter vobis ad intuendum propoſui; Quid ſuum habeat, quidque ab aliis rebuſpublicis, Gallorum, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, Hispanorum, Germanorum, diverſum, quae civilibus legibus Romanorum in Pandectas &amp; Codicem à Juſtiniano redactis reguntur, enarravi.</hi> The form of Policy and government of <hi>England,</hi> ſaith he, I have as it were in a Map briefly ſet down before you to be ſeen, what it has proper to it ſelf, and what differing from other Common-wealths, to wit, of <hi>France, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Spain, Germany,</hi> which, ſaith he, are ſwayed by thoſe Civil Laws of the Romans, that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> did put into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts and the Code, I have likewiſe ſhewed you.</p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:115997:88"/>
                     <p>The teſtimony alſo of Dr <hi>Hakewill,</hi> a great Divine of this Countrey alſo, is as full to the ſame matter; for in his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Apologie of the power and providence of God,<note n="i" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> ca. <hi>7.</hi> ſect. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> he does not onely rank the Civil Law next to the Law of God, but alſo avows the profeſſours thereof in ſome forreign parts to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally better ſcholars then their Divines; and the Lawyers of this laſt age to be much more able in their learning and skill, then the Lawyers of former ages have been. Of the which he will have the reaſon to be, the great ſway, intereſt and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they have had in the Judicial Courts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that has given them ſuch encouragement. Next Gods Laws, ſaith he, thoſe of the Empire ſeem to challenge their place; howbeit with us, having neither that reward nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment as they deſerve, they have loſt both their rank and dignity: but in forreign parts, where they are cheriſhed and honoured, they marvellouſly flouriſh; inſomuch as in ſome tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine Kingdomes their Lawyers are held, and for the moſt part are undoubtedly more ſufficient Scholars then their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; and within this laſt Centenary, much more ſufficient then the writers and profeſſours of the ſame faculty in many precedent ages, as well in that part which is profeſſed in Schools, as the practick expreſſed in judgments and pleadings. Now for the latter part, which is the practick, ſaith he, it may eaſily be evidenced to any who will be pleaſed to look into it, that by the obſervations, experience, paines, and learning of the Lawyers of thoſe latter ages, it is grown to much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs and perfection then former ages had. Which appears by the judgments, deciſions, arreſts, and pleadings of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Courts of the greateſt part of the Chriſtian Nations, which are extant in great numbers; as the Deciſions of the ſeveral Rotes of <hi>Italy,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> at <hi>Genoa,</hi> at <hi>Bononia,</hi> at <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Peruſium,</hi> and the reſt: the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Imperial Chamber at <hi>Spire,</hi> which is the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of the German Nation; and the arreſts of the ſeveral Courts of Parliament in <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Paris, Aiz, Burdeaux, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,</hi> and the reſt. To which may be added the pleadings of Monſieur <hi>Servine,</hi> the French Kings Advocate, and others of that nature, which are all publiſhed and extant, partly in Latin,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115997:88"/>and partly in their own Languages, with that variety and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as much exceeds the former ages.</p>
                     <p>But to paſs from what is obſerved by our own Countrey-men in this particular, is not there an ancient inſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> that does clearly demonſtrate the ſame thing? for if we were not ſure that the Civil Law did paſs for currant, and were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally embraced in forreign parts, why ſhould we alwayes to this very day obſerve to try and decide all differences, that ariſe between our own Countrey-men and Strangers either upon or beyond the Sea, in the Court of Admiralty; where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are onely after the forme of the Civil Law? And were it not to pleaſe forreigners in the Law they like and allow of, we might when we had them here, ſtrictly hold them to our own Laws. But ſince we muſt trade and traffick with them, it were no indifferency to call them from the trial of that Law which they in ſome part know, and is the Law of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as themſelves make it, to the trial of a Law which they know in no part, and is meer forreign unto them.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe, if the Treaties that we have had with forreign Princes were ſurveyed, it would be found, that they run in the language, and are tranſacted by the skill and knowledge of the ſame Law. It is evident therefore, that it is uſed and accepted of every where upon and beyond the ſeas; ſince that where we deal with ſtrangers moſt, and have moſt variance with them, there it is moſt uſed even amongſt our ſelves:</p>
                     <p>And to the ſame ground and reaſon does Mr <hi>Selden</hi> in his diſcourſe upon <hi>Fleta</hi>

                        </note> impute it, that the practiſe of the Civil Law has been continued alwayes in the Marſhals Court here in <hi>England,</hi> where divers cauſes might ariſe, that might concern ſtrangers; as alſo in the Judiciall Courts in both Univerſities, where ſtrangers for ſtudy ſake do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently come to ſettle: though for my part I cannot think, that the Univerſities uſe it for any other reaſon, then for the pure natural equity and ſound reaſon that is in it above all the Laws in the World beſides; nor for any other end, then that young men trained up and made expert in that profeſſion, when they come abroad, might be more ready in all matters of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation and commerce, that the Prince or State ſhould in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115997:89"/>their dealing with forreign Nations have occaſion to uſe them in, when ever they were call'd to any ſuch imployment; to which the Laws of this Land ſerve nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>It is needleſs in ſo clear a matter to offer any further proof to convince our Countrey-men, that all their neighbours beyond the Seas (that are nevertheleſs wiſe, rich, and potent) do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be judg'd and directed by the Civil Law and the profeſſours of it. I ſhall therefore as touching this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular add but two things, which in my judgment are very well worth the obſervation.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Code (which is a collection of the Emperours Laws onely, from the dayes of <hi>Adrian</hi> unto the age of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf) is in uſe even amongſt the Turkes.<note n="l" place="margin">Stephan. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </note> In order to which it was, as Mr <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith in his diſcourſe upon <hi>Fleta;</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Ca. <hi>5</hi> parag. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> that Mahomet the ſecond, but the firſt Emperour of the Turkes ſo called, when he had won <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from the Chriſtians, he commanded <hi>Maximus</hi> the Patriarch with other books to tranſlate alſo into Arabick <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, the Imperial Codes, which was done; <hi>in futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ut videtur, Mahumedici imperii uſum,</hi> ſayes Mr <hi>Selden;</hi> that is, to be uſeful for the Turkiſh Empire.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, that even in the territory of the Church, where the patrimony and the juriſdiction of the Popes lieth, this Law has in ſome caſes an intereſt of guidance in the Tribunals there too. And yet if the precious worth that is in it, did not cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate them, there are not forcible and weighty reaſons want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make them abhor and decline the ſame: For,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſome of the Chriſtian Roman Emperours, as <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Theodoſius, Martian,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> did ordaine divers Laws for the ordering of Church-matters and Church-men, which ſince the Popes look'd upon as an uſurpation, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon their ſpiritual juriſdiction, Temporal Princes being the diſpoſers of temporal things onely, as they ſuppoſe, and not to meddle with ſpiritual; it might well beget in them an animoſity and diſlike againſt the Law it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Church has a large Law of their own, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law; and ſo large, that it may be thought ſufficient to ſet a rule to all that Churches affairs whatſoever, and need not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row help from any other Law.</p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:115997:89"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, there has alwayes been as it were an emulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which of theſe two Laws ſhould be the moſt potent, and ſpread furtheſt in the Chriſtian World.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Popes in theſe latter ages have not ſtuck to make open proteſtation, that the Pontificial dignity was rather to give Laws to the Emperours, then receive any from them.</p>
                     <p>And are not theſe, if there were no other, grounds enough to make them tender how they admitted the Civil Law into their Territories? yet ſuch has been the power and ſorce of that Law, that it has got footing even in that Spiritual Monarchy; for where ſin againſt God comes not to be reſtrained, or puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, nor the ſoul and conſcience diſciplined in order to its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual welfare (which was the main end of ordaining the Canon Law) but that the caſe is meerly temporal and worldly, and not decided by the Canon Law, there the Civil Law gives the rule even in the Popes dominions; <hi>non vi ſua,</hi> ſayes <hi>Suarez,</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">De legib. lib. <hi>3.</hi> ca. <hi>8.</hi> nu. <hi>3.</hi>

                        <hi>ſed quia Pontifices ita voluerunt,</hi> not that it has any authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power there inherent in it ſelf, but as the Popes have freely entertained the ſame. Nay, <hi>Maranta</hi> in his <hi>Speculum,</hi>

                        </note> adds further, and he cites <hi>Feline,</hi> a great Canoniſt for it; That if the Canon Law has declared it ſelf in the caſe, but is too ſtrict and rigid, and the Civil Law be more fair and equitable, the Civil Law ſhall be rather followed in that caſe, even in the Churches territory, then the Canon Law it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And indeed ſetting aſide ſome few ſpecial differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Civil Law and the Canon as to ſome particulars, the Canon Law is nothing elſe but the Civil Law applied to the uſe of the Church and Church matters. And ſuch a conformity there is between them, that <hi>Rebuffus</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">De Nominat. quaeſt. <hi>5.</hi> nu. <hi>14.</hi>
                        </note> ſayes, the Canon Law is but <hi>Medulla legum &amp; practica juris civilis;</hi> the marrow and ſubſtance of the Civil Law, and the practical application of it to caſes in fact ariſing. And <hi>Cuiacius</hi> plainly averreth,<note n="p" place="margin">Ca. <hi>15.</hi> De ſent. &amp; re judic.</note> that the Canon Law <hi>fere omnia ſumpſit ex jure Civili, &amp; omnino quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid praeclarum eſt in hoc jure, ex jure Civili eſt, nec hujus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres idoneus quiſquam, niſi ſit juris Civilis peritiſſimus;</hi> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly taken out of the Civil, but undoubtedly whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is excellent in it, it has borrowed from the Civil Law, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any one throughly underſtand the Canon Law, that is not firſt perfectly skill'd in the Civil.</p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:115997:90"/>
                     <p>This is not ſo truly averred of the Canon Law, but the ſame may be as juſtly affirmed of the particular Law of every Nation that is any thing famous either for Laws or Government. For undoubtedly, the beſt governed Nations have wrote their Laws by the copy of the Roman, and the Civil Law has been the Womb that has born and brought forth all of them; neither can they judiciouſly clear the obſcure meaning &amp; doubtful ſenſe of their own Laws, without they make uſe of the learning of the Civil Law, from whence they ſprang originally, for a help to interpret them. And therefore which of them ſoever does caſt out of their Territories the Civil Law, they do plainly put out the light of their own Laws, and do abandon and exile that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of which their own Laws, for ſo much as is good in them, are but the off-ſpring; ſince by the teſtimony of <hi>Claudian</hi>

                     <p>AMongſt other notes and characters of Honour, that Nations have beſtowed upon the Roman Law, this is not the leaſt; That it bears to this very day that name and ſtyle, which not only diſtinguiſhes it from the Laws of other Nations, but in a way of eminenty extols and ſets it above them all: for although from that which every City, Countrey, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does obſerve for their binding Law, is derived that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar appellation of the Civil Law of that particular place; as the Municipal Law of <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> may be called The Civil Law of <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Spain:</hi> yet he that is to mention

                     <p>But the common uſe of ſpeaking ſtill to this very day obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the beſt and greateſt Nations, is clean otherwiſe, as oft as mention is to be made of the Law of the Roman State; for albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it you may call it, <hi>The Civil Law of the Romans,</hi> yet does it paſs currently under the ſimple denomination of <hi>The Civil Law;</hi> and you are intended to ſpeak of that peculiar Law, though you do not ſubjoyn the proper name of that ſtate or people. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Roman Emperour did firſt enact it as a Law and as a binding direction to the Roman people; <hi>Quoties non addimus nomen, cujus ſit civitatis, noſtrum ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

What was the reaſon that <hi>Rome</hi> was call'd, <hi>The City,</hi> when there was ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Cities beſides it, but becauſe none came near it in power, greatneſs, riches, or magnificence?

In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and upon the ſame ground is it, that although every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is brought under rule and government, and is not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, has a certain peculiar Civil Law, under which it lives and is governed; yet out of a general belief, that no other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law whatſoever is to be compared with the Roman Law, does it ſtill, as anciently it did, carry away the name and title of, <hi>The Civil Law,</hi> from them all, as being the exacteſt and perfecteſt of all other Laws in the World beſides.</p>

                        <p>The Art and knowledge of doing the pureſt right and moſt natural juſtice, is laid down in the books of the Civil Law; and how it came by degrees to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that now we ſee it in.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Roman Civil Law has not the praeeminence of other Laws in title and denomination onely, but it is thought alſo, that in the books thereof there are laid up ſuch treaſures of humane Wiſdome, Policy, Juſtice, Equity, and natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the art of doing equal juſtice, and the doctrine of true and uncorrupted right is taught by them onely. <hi>Jus,</hi> ſaid Celſus,<note n="t" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1</hi> Dig.

                        <hi>eſt ars aequi &amp; boni;</hi> Law is an art informing what is juſt and good: And <hi>Jurisprudentia,</hi> ſaid the Emperour,<note n="u" place="margin">Parag. <hi>1.</hi> Inſt. cod.</note> 
                        <hi>eſt rerum divinarum atque humanarum notitia, juſti atque injuſti ſcientia;</hi> The ſcience of the Law teaches what is the right both in Holy and Worldly things, and what is juſt and unjuſt; both ſpeaking of the Roman Law: ſo was it accounted then, and no otherwiſe is it accounted now too. For,</p>
                     <p>Whereas the learned of the world do reckon upon three ſupreme Arts and Sciences, Divinity, Law, and Phyſick, which do ſo mainly ſupport and hold up the whole frame of Man, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115997:91"/>without them this goodly linke of things here below muſt needs diſſolve and fall away to nothing; by the Art of Law, it is far from their meaning to comprehend the Municipal Law of any Nation, which is fitted for the climate of one people onely, and ſerves for the exigencies and occaſions of the State, and varies as times and occaſions, and the diſpoſitions of the men do vary; which commands rather then teaches; which has an eye more to what is profitable to the publick, then what is juſt and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and which deals more in the great advantages of State, then in ſetling private intereſts, or compoſing differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man: (for this is the true ſtate of the locall conſtitutions of the ſeveral and reſpective Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the World; each of them being far ſhort of deciding thoſe many doubts and queſtions, that muſt needs happen in great variety between their ſubjects, whileſt they trade and deal together.) But they underſtand ſome more Univerſal Law, that is commonly embraced and allowed of by the beſt and moſt potent Nations; that is full of pure equity and true reaſon, and being grounded upon dictates of nature and common reaſon, is unchangeable; whoſe method is to teach and inſtruct by certain rules and principles orderly and handſomly digeſted, as well as to command and order; and which amongſt the frequent and various dealings of men, does leave few caſes that can happen undecided.</p>
                     <p>And it is evident, that by this Art of Law, they intend no other but the Roman Civil Law: for although the Laws have been a making almoſt ever ſince <hi>Rome</hi> was firſt built, and were ordained as queſtions did ariſe from time to time, and under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral forms of government; <hi>Rome</hi> being ſometimes under the rule of one, ſometimes of more, and ſometimes of the whole people; and grew at laſt to an infinite multitude, and lay in a confuſed and indigeſted heap, void of all order or method: Yet at laſt <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> when he came to the Empire, did ſet upon that <hi>opus desperatum,</hi> as he calls it in his <hi>Proaeme</hi> to the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, that deſperate enterprize of diſpoſing them into that admirable order that now we ſee them in; and indeed was the firſt that laid the foundation for the building up of the Art and Science of Law.</p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:115997:92"/>
                     <p>By his means it was, that after the beſt and moſt uſefull Laws were ſelected and choſen out of a vaſt and tumultuous heap, they were diſtributed into Titles, and the Titles into Books, every Title contains thoſe Laws that are proper and pertinent to that principal ſubject whereof that Title treateth; ſometimes by definition opening the true ſtate and nature of it; ſometimes if it be various, dividing it into its ſeveral kinds and branches: alſo ſubjoyning a reſolution of the ſeveral caſes and queſtions that come under it, rather by the ſtill voice of right reaſon, and as all men by their natural inſtinct, and practical experience would agree to determine them, then by ſovereign command or imperial will.</p>
                     <p>After this method is that principal part of the Law the Digeſts, otherwiſe called the Pandects compoſed; which <hi>Duarenus</hi> cals the Magazine and Store-houſe of all equity, juſtice, and learning, and the artificial framing thereof <hi>Cuiacius</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Parat. Dig. Mandat.</note> does ſo much admire, that he judges them to be fools and illiterate, and not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, neither what Art is, nor what the principles of Law are, nor how well the Pandects are made, that ſhould require any other Art then what is to be found in them. <hi>Tully,</hi> ſayes <hi>Alciat,</hi> had long and ſollicitous thoughts, <hi>de jure Civili in artem redigendo,</hi> of making an Art of the Civil Law; but <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in the <hi>Digeſts</hi> hath done that work.</p>
                     <p>But to make this ſcience of the Law yet perfecter, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> hath alſo added his book of Inſtitutions, for no other end, but, as himſelf teſtifies, <hi>ut ſint totius legitimae ſcientiae prima elementa,</hi> the introduction to the whole Law, they being indeed the ſumme and ſubſtance of it: and he directs it, <hi>cupidae legum juventuti,</hi> to thoſe that ſhall deſire to enter upon that ſtudy; intending it as a help to the younger ſtudents onely, whereby they might be enabled after the reading thereof, the better to undertake the more difficult and voluminous books of the Law: for he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that the other volumes of the Law would prove too hard and tedious for young beginners, and ſo it might come to paſs, that the whole ſtudy of the Law might be quite laid aſide, and utterly periſh for want of ſome to ſtudy the ſame, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this little book of Inſtitutions to be made, whereby young men might be invited partly with the briefneſs, and partly with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115997:92"/>the eaſineſs thereof, to the ſtudy and profeſſion of it. Here then is a great body of Law orderly and methodically diſpoſed, and a book of praeliminary Inſtitutions alſo, to make the entrance into it eaſier and more beneficial.</p>
                     <p>But there are two Volumes more of this Law alſo, the one collected by <hi>Justinian</hi> as the Digeſts were, and that's the Code; the other ordained by him, as the Inſtitutions were, and that's the Authenticks, otherwiſe called the Novell Conſtitutions: for the firſt is but a bare collection of ſuch deciſions, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours that had ſate in the Roman Empire even to <hi>Juſtinians</hi> time had made to the queſtions that had been propounded to them, ſometimes by Judges, and ſometimes by private perſons, as in contingency they fell; and are ranked in the ſame order and method as the Digeſts are. In the Authenticks there is not that order obſerved in the diſpoſition of Laws as is either in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, or the Code, but as occaſion was offered of any doubt, wherein the Princes reſolution was neceſſary to every thing, ſo it is ſet down without any other method or form. And they were call'd the Novels, becauſe they were new Laws, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Laws of the Digeſts, Inſtitutions, or the Code; and ſometimes they alter and correct the Laws of the other three.</p>
                     <p>Thus far went <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf in his deſign of a general ſurvey and diſpoſure of the Roman Laws; ſometimes ordaining Laws of his own, and ſometimes gathering together the Laws of others, till he had made an exact and abſolute compoſition. Which enterpriſe that renowned ſcholar and Stateſman of our Countrey Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> does ſo much commend and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, in his Epiſtle to Queen <hi>Elizàbeth,</hi> ſet before his book of Maxims of Law, that when he underſtood, that ſhe had the like purpoſe in her breaſt, to enter into a general amendment of the ſtate of her Laws, and to reduce them to more brevity and certainty; he ſaith, it ſtruck him with great admiration, when he heard it; and acknowledges it to be one of the moſt choſen works, and of higheſt merit and beneficence towards the ſubject, that ever entred into the mind of any King; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that there be rare preſidents of it in government, as it cometh to paſs in things ſo excellent, there being no preſident
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115997:93"/>full in view but that of <hi>Justinian,</hi> as he confeſſeth. Whoſe work is the more to be admired, becauſe the uſe thereof is not local, nor reſtrained to the ſtate and policy of one Nation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as hers would have been, but may ſerve for the uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of any ſtate or people whatſoever, and is ſubſervient to all accidents and occaſions that can happen in common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and inded has for its object ſuch things, as commonly ariſe every where throughout the World, and have no Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal or cuſtomary Law to determine them.</p>
                     <p>But if <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſhould be thought to have failed in any thing of bringing this Art to a full perfection, yet what the learned of Chriſtendome from his time downward to this preſent, has done towards the perfecting thereof, will make it up: for the infinite number of writers of all ſorts, of all Nations, and in all ages, that have wrote hereupon, are prodigious to behold, and wonderful to conſider.</p>
                     <p>What Gloſſes, Notes, Lectures, Repetitions, Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Paratitles, Analyſes, Intellects, are there upon the very Laws themſelves? There is hardly any Text of Law that is not copiouſly written on, either in ſtating the true reading of it, or in clearing it from obſcurity, or in enlarging upon the matter of it. Then as to the general ſubjects of the Law, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes and queſtions that fall under them, both ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and practicall, the Tractats, Diſcourſes, Counſels, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, Reports, common Opinions, Controverſies, Reſolutions, Practices, Obſervations, and Singulars, are without number.</p>
                     <p>Even this latter age of ours, beſides all that which foregoing antiquity has produced, has brought forth every where in all Countreys of renown ſo many famous writers in this kind, that every Nation has ſeemed to be at an emulous contention each with other, which ſhould moſt excel in ſuch men.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>France,</hi> are reckoned <hi>Cuiacius, Briſſonius, Molinaus, Antonie Faber, Peter Faber, Rebuffus, Bodinus, Tholoſanus, Gothofred, Choppinus, Bellonus, Papo, Charondas, Hottoman,</hi> all of high account in that faculty.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Every one of theſe has left ſuch writings behind him in the Civil Law, as will makes their memories immortal. Neither can it be any wonder, that the Civil Law it ſelf, and the books thereof are grown ſo voluminous and almoſt infinite. Becauſe indeed that Science does comprehend that vaſt and great variety of affairs and worldly buſineſs, that the large Nation of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans dealt in during the long continuance of that great and large Empire. And ſince have been added unto it, and ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as it were by the rule thereof, and applied unto it, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of many Nations, which muſt in all changes and accidents, and in each Nation be many, various, and ſeveral from the time of that Empire down to this preſent. Which being ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally writ upon, by ſeveral fancies, and in ſeveral wayes and methods, muſt needs produce throughout the World large and copious writings in this faculty, as it has in all other Arts and Sciences beſides. But the benefit that the world reaps thereby, lies in this, that there neither is or can be any contract made, or any human affair tranſacted, either Domeſtick, Civil, or Military, either between governours and governed, or between the people themſelves one with another, or between Nation and Nation, either upon ſea or upon land, but by the help of that ſtudy and the writings thereof, there may be found moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rules and directions; ſometimes to diſcern the true nature of the thing it ſelf; ſometimes to diſcern its kinds; ſometimes to reſolve the doubts and queſtions that fall under it; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to juſtifie it as wholly good and lawful; and ſometimes to condemn it as altogether unjuſt and evil. And if the action be not uniform, but various, and may be in ſome caſes good and in others evil, it will diſtinguiſh upon the ſeveral caſes; that dealers may walk ſecurely and ſafely, if they will guide their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115997:94"/>actions by the preſcript of that Law, where the Laws and cuſtomes of their own Countrey doe not direct them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                     <p>No part of this pains has been taken or honour done by the learned of forreign States to the Municipal Law of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides the Roman; for although every State may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully affect and be delighted with their own Laws, and ſo it may come to paſs, that they may be greatly extoll'd and ſet up, and ſometimes with much induſtry and great benefit to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects interpreted, explained, and writ upon by the writings of their own Countrey-men; yet are they of ſo little eſteem and account with forreigners, that they almoſt diſdain to read them. But where any have imployed their pens in writing upon a Law of another Nation, no one example can be given, but in the Civil Law onely; which has buſied and ſet on work the learned of the whole World.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, what high applauſe ſoever may be given to the local conſtitutions of any people (as queſtionleſs they are all uſeful within their proper territories) yet it is a truth unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, that in the account of other Nations, whatſoever the caſe or queſtion be; be it between their own ſubjects, ſo that their own National Laws and cuſtomes do not ſpecially order it; or be it between them and other Princes, or their ſubjects, the Civil Law is the ſtraiteſt rule and the beſt guide to decide it by; and the art and skill to diſpenſe equal right and exact juſtice to all men, is to be learnt from the ſtudy of no other Law of mans creation but that Law onely. <hi>Nihil aliud eſt jus Civile, quàm ſententiae quaedam à veteribus Juriſconſult is pronunciatae, quae in certum redactae ordinem, dijudicandi rationem noſtr is Juriſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is oſtendunt,</hi> ſays <hi>Machiavell</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Prooem</hi> to his books <hi>de republica.</hi> The Civil Law is nothing more then certain dictates or principles declared by the ancient lawyers (undoubtedly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Papinian, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian, Scaevola, Africanus, Pomponius, Neratins, Celſus, Marcianus,</hi> and the reſt, whoſe names are prefixed before their ſeveral Laws in the Digeſt) which being put into good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, do inſtruct others in the wayes of adminiſtring right and juſtice. And hence is it, that in all the Univerſities through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, I will not except <hi>England,</hi> the Law that is ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115997:94"/>the Law that is publickly read and taught in their Schools, the Law wherein degrees are taken, is the Civil Law.</p>

                        <p>An Anſwer to the main Objections that are now adayes made againſt the continuance of the Civil Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Nation.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THeſe things that have been thus truly delivered to the praiſe and commendation of the Civil Law, being clear and evident, our Adverſaries the Anticivilians will not ſo vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend, as to oppoſe them, or to detract from the worth of that learning, which has been ſo generally owned by all the World, nor was ever brought into any queſtion, ſince it was firſt propagated and made known to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions beſides the Roman. They will, as they muſt, admit and acknowledge, that the Civil Law doth more abound with natural reaſon and equity, then any other Law of mans eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing; that it has ſpread further into the World, then any Law ever did; and has been more ſtudied and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the writings of the learned of all Nations and langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then any Law that yet has been; that the profeſſion thereof is of ſo large a compaſs, that it takes in and treats of all the affairs, contracts, and dealings of the World; that Princes freely entertain it into their Judicatories, and miniſter right and juſtice onely by the learned and Graduates of that profeſſion; that the principles of ſolid wiſdome and beſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Honeſty are taught thereby; that it has deſcribed and ſet down the duties of all people of what relation ſoever, more amply, and more to the pattern of nature and right reaſon then any other Law has done. Yet this free and ample acknowledgment notwithſtanding, they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the uſe and practiſe thereof in the miniſtration of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115997:95"/>juſtice within this nation to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venient or neceſſary, ſuggeſting to themſelves certain reaſons ſtrong and important, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, why that profeſſion how learned and wiſe ſoever in it ſelf, yet ſince it is become uſeleſs, as to the people of this Nation, it cannot conveniently, as our affairs are now changed, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued here any longer, as they imagine. Which opinion how well it is grounded, it is meet and requiſite we ſhould in the next place examine; for except it may be maintained that it is alſo uſefull and very neceſſary for the Common-wealth under which we now live, and no way, or at leaſt, in compariſon of the great benefits thereof, not conſiderably inconvenient, all the other excellencies and rare qualities that can be ſpoken thereof, will turn but into a ſpeculative and ayrie diſcourſe, and will move nothing towards the begetting of a publick ſettlement thereof within the Nation: for, they will ſay, all rules and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that are uſeful to inform the underſtanding, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion the manners and actions of private men or of Princes, as they are men onely, may not preſently be fitting or neceſſary to regulate and direct a State in the carrying on of publick buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Let it therefore be added for a further commendation of the Imperial Law; firſt, that as it containes the dictates of nature, the concluſions of right reaſon, and as it ſets forth the natural and eſſential properties of ſuch humane things, contracts and dealings of men, whereof it treats, (of all which without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon the greateſt plenty lies recorded in the writings of the Civil Law) I ſay, as it containes all theſe, it is ſo eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the well ordering of all States and the common affairs of men, that it cannot be a boliſhed through any change of Law or government whatſoever, but at the ſame inſtant the peace and well being of that State and people muſt needs vaniſh and diſſolve alſo: For can the Sun fall from the firmament, and the world not be at an end? or the ſoule expire, and the body not be void of life or motion? No more can the ſplendour of that people endure any longer, where the ſun of natural equity and juſtice has left to ſhine amongſt them; nor can the body of a Common-wealth grow proſperous or flouriſhing, that is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the ſoundneſs of right reaſon, which is the very ſoul
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115997:95"/>and ſpirit of all Law and government: for in this it is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with a whole ſociety of men, then it is with one individual perſon.</p>
                     <p>If a man ſhall be unnatural, and cares not to obſerve true right and juſt reaſon in his dealings with other men, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renders himſelf odious and deteſtable to all men, and it is lookt upon as dangerous to have any dealings or to be familiar with ſuch a perſon. So if a State, which is a collective body of men, when they are appealed to for common right, either by their own people, or by other Nations, ſhall adminiſter that for right, which croſſes natural juſtice, and the notions of right reaſon, it expoſes it ſelf to ſcorn and obloquie, it gaules and exaſperates their own ſubjects, and makes their neighbours ſtand at a diſtance with them: and the condition of that State muſt needs be dangerous and unſure, having loſt their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both at home and abroad. Onely here is the difference, and it is a ſad one; The danger of particular injuſtice deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in ſome detriment of a few; but national injuſtice drawes after it ofttimes the ruine and confuſion of many Nations.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the impreſſions of nature and reaſon are ſo ſtrong in man and ſo great a part of his eſſence, that they cannot be quite expunged or deleted in him; neither can they be ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued, but they will at length have their return — <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram expellas furcalicet, uſque recurret</hi> — and inclinations and affections thereunto will appear, even when the contrary is performed. So true is that of the Civil Law, <hi>Jura naturalia ſunt immutabilia;</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Parag. <hi>11.</hi> Inſt. De jur. nat. geut. &amp; Civil.</note> The Laws of nature and the common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of nations are unchangeable, and are not capable to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
                     <p>For if it were once admitted, that theſe Laws were alterable, what ſtrange contradictions and ſenſleſs incongruities would follow? And how would man be raviſhed as it were from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his reaſon one chief part of his eſſence being taken away? Beſides, how would ſins and treſpaſſes againſt nature multiply? How common would natural injuſtice be? and what loud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints thereof would ariſe? whereby not onely great confuſion would break in, and the peace of the Common-wealth be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115997:96"/>but the common ſociety of Nations would in time alſo ceaſe. The Civil Law then, as it is natural, eſſential, or rational, cannot be repealed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let it be ſpoken to its praiſe alſo, that the Civil Law is ſo far from being made uſeleſs to a Nation, where the whole ſtate of Government has been ſubverted, as that it is thereby become more uſeful and neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, that the Roman people themſelves thought it ſo, when they diſpatcht certain choſen men on purpoſe to fetch it from <hi>Athens</hi> for their uſe and ſervice, after they had driven out their Kings, ſuppreſſed their Laws, and erected a popular government in place of the Regal. The like opinion poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth now adayes the Princes and potentates of the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> as is clearly demonſtrated by their admitting the learning and profeſſion thereof into their ſeveral Territories, that it may be at hand to decide and reſolve ſuch caſes and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of right, that happen amongſt their people, wherein a Law of their own is wanting.</p>
                     <p>Nay, if any ſuch difference or controverſie ariſes between the Princes themſelves, or between Nation and Nation, which is moſt frequent and common; becauſe there never was nor can be by any authority a poſitive Law made to bind them, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and argue ſuch differences by arguments fetcht from the Civil Law, and allow of the reaſon thereof as a moſt competent and equal rule to decide them by.</p>
                     <p>And if this ſupply of juſtice by the learning and knowledge of the Civil Law were taken away too, what ignorance, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, arbitrarineſs, injuſtice, and oppreſſion would the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the world lie under? and what hazards of detriment or ruine would their rights, fortunes, and eſtates be expoſed unto? for where all manner of Law is wanting in a Common weale, to do the acts of juſtice and miniſtration of right by, it muſt be granted, that the light of natural reaſon muſt of neceſſity be the Law; ſince that was the onely means which was given to man at firſt to judge and diſcern by of humane things, before any Law was given. But if that ſhould depend upon the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring fancies and imaginations of men onely, and not be illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by ſome right knowledge and learning, under how many

                     <p>And where would the certainty, conſtancy, and unity of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice be, when the Judges of the ſame Tribunal furniſhed with bare natural endowments onely, would differ from and oppoſe one another? when one Tribunal ſhall judge directly oppoſite to another upon one and the ſame fact, or (which is a levity ſhameful and unbeſeeming) when the Judges of the ſame Court in caſes of like nature, ſhall judge and order diverſly from that which they had done before?<note n="z" place="margin">Apud Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos prius quàm ſententiam fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, praeco clara vice judioes ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> Under which uncertainty and diſcordance how ſhall people know what to expect, when their rights come into queſtion? What can any Counſel adviſe? Or what caution or adviſedneſs can be uſed by men, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their affairs out of jeopardy, when they are never cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of that juſtice to which they ſhould conform themſelves, and be ſecure?</p>
                     <p>By the converſion and change of State therefore, though the Municipal Law goes to wrack (as commonly ſuch great frames are ſeldome medled withal, but all falls a pieces) the Civil Law is not the leſs, but rather the more neceſſary to be retained ſtill; Firſt, becauſe it hath no coherence or conglutination with the particular cuſtomes or government, either Regal or Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, as the Municipal Law hath, and ſo the one may fall, and yet the other ſtand. Secondly, becauſe the Civil Law is the proper Art and Science of that right natural reaſon, which for want of other rules in the doing of juſtice, we have ſaid muſt neceſſarily be the common ſtandard to try all things by. The principles of which Art and Science are not weak or ſuperficial, but ſtrong and ſolid; not various or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but certain and agreeing; not harſh and rigorous, but tender, compaſſionate, and equitable; not partial to any, but alike juſt to all; not obſcure and perplexed, but clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the eyes of judicious and right diſcerning men, though above the reach of the vulgar. Thirdly, becauſe in carries the weight of undeniable authority along with it, the deciſions thereof being not the ſudden fancies and raw conceits
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115997:97"/>of a few men, nor do they reſt upon the bare Reports of any, how learned in the Law ſoever, but they are the clear evidence of Reaſon, and the prudent adviſements and mature deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a whole State, excelling in wiſdome, mighty in greatneſs, and famous in renown.</p>
                     <p>And howſoever it was at firſt ordained to be a Law for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nation to be ruled by, yet has it ſince been made univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal in uſe throughout <hi>Europe;</hi> and by the general conſent of all the learned ſprung up to an Art or Science, to teach natural juſtice and equity to all mankind. Fourthly, becauſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Civil Law does not onely rightly inform and teach the underſtanding what is juſt and right, but the certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of does keep the judgment ſteddy, and unexpoſed to thoſe fits of variation and inſtability, which thoſe that are directed by no certain principles, are ſubject to; for it is not eaſie for them to vary, who have any fixed rules to guide them: So that if this Law were duly applied by thoſe onely that are learned in it (ſince it is not poſſible to be done by any other ſort of men) neither ignorance, nor errour, nor arbitrarineſs, nor uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of juſtice, nor the conſequences thereof, wrong, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or oppreſſion would be found, at leaſt they would not be ſo frequent and common, as where the guidance and light of ſuch a Law is wanting.</p>
                     <p>But beſides theſe foregoing reaſons, there are yet further and much ſtronger reaſons to be added, why thoſe matters and cauſes, which before the preſent change of government did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the trial and determination of the Civil Law, ſhould be kept within the ſame cogniſance ſtill, theſe alterations notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Firſt, becauſe for many hundreds of years, that and no other his been the ſtanding, approved, and practiſed Law in thoſe matters, and therefore in that regard to be preferred before any new Law, though better, if ſuch a one could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be found. Secondly, becauſe if it ſhould be laid aſide, it would be ſo impoſſible to finde a better, that we ſhould find no Law or rule at all, to put in the room thereof, that would be able to decide them with any tolerable diſcretion or knowledge. The profeſſours of the Municipal Law muſt acknowledge, that their Book caſes (the onely learning of their Law) muſt needs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115997:97"/>here fail them, when not any of thoſe matters were ever judg'd or tried before them. Where then would the Law or rule be found? And ſurely from that we have before ſaid, it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconvenient to commit the triall of them to ſuch as have neither Law or knowledge proper for the determination of them. Thirdly, becauſe thereby ſo eminent and ſo uſeful a profeſſion might be kept up; which elſe to the great diſhonour and dammage of this Nation muſt irrecoverably fall, and be quite extinct. Fourthly, becauſe if theſe things were ſuffered to go on in their accuſtomed way, it would make this great change of State to be the leſs, which in all alterations is to be wiſhed and ſought after. Fifthly, becauſe there was nothing in the nature of thoſe cauſes to tie them to the former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely; but that they may be tried under the name and authority of the preſent government, and yet as much accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of the Civil Law, as they were before; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Civil Law is fitted to act under any government. It can ſerve the Church, as well as the State; the Popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as the Regall; and the Ariſtocratical, as well as either; as we ſhall clearly find if we look into the States abroad, as <hi>France, Spain,</hi> the Empire, the Territories of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the States of the Low Countreys, the States of <hi>Italy,</hi> the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe differing in point of government does not hinder, but that the Civil Law is uſed and practiſed in them all.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon whereof is, becauſe it meddles not with matters of government at all, but was originally made to order the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs of the people, and to judge the matter of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween party and party onely; as may appear by the very ſtate and purport of the Laws themſelves, which are as anſwers made to queſtions onely concerning matters of private right and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, as they did ariſe from time to time, during the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Roman Empire. Beſides, the Romans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after they had expulſed their Kings, ſaw ſeveral kindes of government, and yet the Civil Law ſerved under them all. And if it did not ſtand indifferent in this point of government, ſo many Princes and States herein very much diſagreeing, would not ſo freely admit it into their Territories, as they do; for can
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115997:98"/>we think, that they would conſent to the admittance of any thing that might endanger their government? So that it is clear, the change of government that has been amongſt us, does not at all hinder, but that as long as the ſame cauſes as well Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time as others, do remain, and muſt neceſſarily have a Trial, the Civil Law, that tried them before, is the fitteſt Law to try them ſtill.</p>
                     <p>It is of as little force and moment, and ought to hinder no more, which is objected, That the Civil Law is a forreign Law, not ordained by the Legiſlative power and authority of this Nation; and therefore very inconvenient it may ſeem, that matters ariſing here ſhould be ordered by any other Law, then which is of our own making, or that we ſhould be made to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any other. Beſides, to have two Laws tolerated in one State, may cauſe great diſtraction and uncertainty amongſt the people, who may under ſeveral pretences be troubled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented under both for one and the ſame thing. Further, the entertaining of the Civil Law, may in time be a means to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and undermine the Municipal Law and cuſtomes of this Nation.</p>
                     <p>For as to its being a forreign Law, what is it more in that, then the Laws of the Saxons, Danes, and Normans; of the which our Engliſh Antiquaries, <hi>Cambden,</hi>

And yet it is not ſuch a ſtranger amongſt us neither, as may be conceived; for not onely Antiquity will tell us, that when the Romans were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of this Nation, and during the continuance of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and power here (which was no leſs then 500 years) all the affairs of this Nation were ordered and carried on by the Roman Civil Law; and had no Law to aſſiſt, much leſs to check it in all that time.<note n="e" place="margin">Cambdens Britan. fo. 63.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115997:98"/>as I may ſay, naturalized by our ſelves into this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it ought not to be reputed or look'd upon by us a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any longer.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, right reaſon from what hand ſoever it comes preſented, ought to be embraced by us;<note n="f" place="margin">Rationabile dictum debet ita movere judicem ed judicandum, ſicut ipſa lex.

                        </note> But when beſides its own commanding power and vertue, it comes withall recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuch a wiſe State as the Roman was, and framed into a Law by them, and has ſince been allowed of by other Nations alſo, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming with the general reaſon of Man; ſurely it ought not to be lookt upon as ſtrange and forreign unto us or to our affairs, carrying about as the ſame reaſon, and dealing in the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that they did, meerly becauſe we did not promulgate and enact the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if we will deal in forreign affairs, and lanch forth into the wide Ocean, and converſe with forreign people, and have to do with ſhipping, negotiation, and traffick, without which (ſo populous are we grown) we are not able ſo much as to ſubſiſt or live; or if we would be enabled to ſtand upon our own defence againſt a Nation that ſhall aſſault us by a war; or revenge unſufferable injuries done us by making war upon them; we muſt not then ſtand upon our own Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority, to which other Princes and people will not be obliged;<note n="h" place="margin">Conſuetudines vel ſtatuta ſunt localia, &amp; fie non obligant niſi ſubditos. <hi>Gail. obſ. lib 2. obſ. 124. nu. 5.</hi>
                        </note> but we muſt be contented to ſtand and ſubmit our ſelves to ſuch a Law how forreign ſoever, as is proper for thoſe very matters, and to which other Nations do refer themſelves; which is the Civil Law, that Nature has breathed out it ſelf in, and Nations have conſented unto.</p>
                     <p>And if it be ſo neceſſary for the carrying on of forreign affairs, that they cannot be tranſacted without it, this ſhews a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of admitting of it alſo in the agitation of certain matters and cauſes at home and amongſt our ſelves, for the more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reward and encouragement of that profeſſion; which can
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115997:99"/>never be maintained or upheld by the tranſaction of forreign affairs onely; which is not deſired neither in any greater lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or meaſure, then has been alwayes allowed it heretofore, and where the Common-Law has never known to intermeddle: and in which if the Civil Law ſhould not be uſed, queſtions and differences would ariſe, and there would be no Law or Rule found to ſettle them, which would be a very pernicious thing: So that be the authority of the Civil Law forreign, which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, except it were impoſed upon us by ſome other Nation or people; or be it that it were of no authority at all, but what the neceſſary aſſent of our own natural reaſon, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Nations gives it; yet it were ſtrange that we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to have no Law at all in thoſe matters, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or entertain the ſame for a help to direct our judgments in them.</p>
                     <p>It being then ſo neceſſary a Law, that but by the knowledg and conduct thereof forreign affairs cannot poſſibly be carried on, and there would be a manifeſt failer of juſtice in other matters at home without it; the ſuppoſed inconvenience of having two Laws in one and the ſame Nation, ſo much urged againſt it, will appear to be a very ſlender and inconſiderable thing; for how can that inconvenience hurt us more, then it does other Nations, that have Municipal Laws of their own, and yet do keep the Civil Law too? Beſides, it is ſo far from being an inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it is both a benefit and an honour to a people to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in juſtice, and to have it rather ſupplied by two Laws, then to fail in the doing thereof by having but one.</p>
                     <p>And though where there be two Laws, and two diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of them in one State, if the matters and cauſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are ſeverally allowed the cognizance, be not certainly aſſigned to each, that the one may not enterfire with the other, there may ariſe a confuſion of juriſdictions, and the ſubject will be uncertain whither to goe for juſtice, and may be in danger to be moleſted by both Courts for one and the ſame thing, which were an intollerable miſchief:<note n="i" place="margin">Gravius pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatorum damno peccatur, eùm inter ſummos magiſtratus, curiaſve majores de imperio cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur. <hi>Bodin. de rep. lib. 3. ca. 6.</hi>
                        </note> Yet the Courts of the Civil Law have alwayes had their limits particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly preſcribed them, and the cauſes within their cogniſance punctually ſet down; and if they hold plea of any thing elſe,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115997:99"/>there is a known remedy to be had to ſtop them, by bringing prohibitions from the Common-Law, which are never ſo ſoon ask'd, as granted. But if the Common-Law Courts ſhall draw to their examination ſuch matters as do properly belong to the Civil, (as they have done too often) or do prohibit the Civil from proceeding, where they know they can do no right nor give any relief themſelves, as in the buſineſs of allotting porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt the deceaſeds kindred, which they never did nor can do, nor will ſuffer the Civil Law Courts to do it neither, this an heavy vexation, but the blame muſt lie upon them. But to be ſure, whileſt there is ſuch a correcting hand over the Courts of the Civil Law, there is little ground of fear that they can trouble or moleſt the people further then their juſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er does authoriſe them. Which may be ſufficient alſo to remove the jealouſies of thoſe that fear, if the Civil ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it may in time ſupplant and undermine the Municipal Law of this Nation: For it were a vain attempt for ſubordinate Courts to go about to ſhake the ſtanding of that Law, to whoſe check and controule they lie continually ſubject.</p>
                     <p>And if in forreign Nations (that have their Municipal Laws all of them, but no profeſsion, nor Lawyers, nor Judges, but of the Civil Law onely) there is not any found ſo bold and preſumptuous, that dares at any time to ſet up the Civil Law above the particular Law or Cuſtome of the place, though op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to do it are not wanting, but that the particular Law or Cuſtome, if any be in the caſe, does prevail, and has the praeeminence alwayes; ſurely then the Municipal Law and cuſtomes of <hi>England</hi> are much more ſecure from being inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and incroched upon, when not onely the Law is diſtinct, but there is a diſtinct profeſsion thereof alſo from the Civil Law, that bears a watchfull eye towards its own greatneſs, and which is more, that has a controuling power, and as it were a ſovereignty over the other. Beſides, the very principles of the Civil Law do run clean counter to any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, it being an expreſs Maxime in that Law, That the Municipal Law and cuſtome of any State for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thoſe that are ſubject to it, ought to be preferr'd before any more Univerſal Law that is to the contrary.

                        </note> And as I have ſaid before often, ſo I muſt inculcate it here ſtill; The Civil Law, where ever it is admitted, it comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt prejudice to any, either Law, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, or government, nor alters any thing; but is an auxiliary ſupplement or a knowledg aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the adminiſtration of right and juſtice both to ſubjects, and between Nation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where there is no Municipal Law in the caſe, or where it is imperfect and obſcure, or where a locall Law is of no authority at all. In the one it ſupplies, in the other it interprets, in the laſt it moderates, as a moſt indifferent Umpire.</p>
                     <p>So that of theſe two Laws the proper office and function is, without drawing ſeveral wayes, and claſhing one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or queſtioning each others power, ſweetly to joyn both in that moſt excellent and divine work of juſtice, which may render the people of this Nation moſt quiet within themſelves, and honourably eſteemed by others.</p>
                     <p>But laſtly, there is a ſtrange conceit that has got into the heads of ſome men. That the Civil and Canon Law are one and the ſame, that they cannot be ſevered, that if the one be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the other will have acceſs alſo, and the letting in of the Canon Law, which was ordained by the Popes and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> will open a wide gap to introduce all their ſuperſtition, erroneous doctrine, and prelatical diſcipline; and ſo in time we ſhall become wholly Romiſh and Antichriſtian And truly I muſt confeſs, that ſuch a cauſe, that might produce ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an effect, is not to be neglected, but is to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look'd after. But as in the one the ſuppoſition is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken, ſo there is no ſuch cauſe of fear in the other, not any ſuch danger as is ſurmiſed: for that theſe two Laws are the ſame, or that they are inſeparable, is more then a ſmall miſtake. They were made at ſeveral times, long diſtant each from other, by ſeveral authors, and for ſeveral ends and purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>The Civil Law, after it had been growing by degrees in a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115997:100"/>very long proceſs of time, as well under the people, when <hi>Rome</hi> was a free State, as under the Emperours; being become vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous and indigeſted, the choyceſt thereof was pickt out and laid together by <hi>Juſtinian;</hi> and that Collection was perfected in the year 533, and made the Law of the Empire, whereof <hi>Rome</hi> was now no part or member, but become the land of the Church, the place for the Popes and Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſit in. Who though they made canons for the rule of the Church and Church-men long before, yet the Canon Law, that is now ſo ſtyled, came not forth into the world till above 500 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the firſt part thereof, which is <hi>Gratians</hi> decree, being not publiſhed till the year 1151.</p>
                     <p>The intent and purpoſe of the Civil Law was, to order and direct all the Civil affairs of the great and ſpacious Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: And the buſineſs of the Canon Law was to guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical matters of the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> the one was ordained to rule a State, the other to diſcipline a Church. Theſe conſiderations then dividing and ſetting apart theſe two Laws each from other, do manifeſtly ſhew, that they are neither the ſame, nor for the ſame end made, nor yet inſeparable; for if that mighty State of the Romans could man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and carry on ſo much buſineſs as they dealt in, by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law onely, what need has any leſſer Nation now to make uſe of the Canon Law at all? Beſides, there has been alwayes ſuch a contention between theſe two Laws for ſuperiority, and which ſhould have moſt eſteem with the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> that they have been rather ready to fight as foes, then unite and agree as friends.

                        </note> writes, that when Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the ſecond did ſollicit the Europaean Princes and people to give admittance to the Canon Law within their Territories, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to enlarge his own juriſdiction and greatneſs, they did the more freely receive and entertain the Civil Law, that they might the better keep off both the Pope and his Law too. So that it ſhould rather ſeem they are ſo far from being inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that to entertain the one, is the onely means to ſhut out the other.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the Canon Law is unneceſſary where the Civil is in uſe; for it is well known, that the latter Roman

                     <p>And whoſoever does take a ſurvey of the Canon Law in the Titles above mentioned, and in divers others, he ſhall finde it moſt taken out, and ſpeak the very language of the Civil Law: and ſo much is noted and obſerved all along by the very Gloſs and Canoniſts themſelves. So that hereby the Canon Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115997:101"/>to be of little uſe, when for the ordering of thoſe matters, we may be ſupplied from the fountain it ſelf, from whence the Canon Law has got it. But ſuppoſe there were ſuch a neceſſary concomitancy between theſe two Laws, and that the uſe and practiſe of the one would be a ſure inlet to the other, as ſome do too fondly imagine; does it therefore follow, that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and ſuperſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needs creep in too? No more ſurely, then it follows, that becauſe the old Law, that is full of Jewiſh rights and ceremonies, is joyned to the Goſpel, and that we read both together, we muſt therefore preſently all become Jews.</p>
                     <p>And thus having ſatiſfied all ſcruples, that are uſually made againſt the continuing the Civil Law within this Nation; I ſhall but ſhut up all in this concluſion: That ſeing the Roman State, out of their wonderful wiſdome and great experience in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the ſeveral affairs of the World, did deviſe a Law not onely proper for themſelves, but ſo mainly uſeful to other Nations alſo; and that the induſtry of the learned working upon that foundation, has by method, order, Rules, expoſitions, illuſtrations, and treatiſes of all kinds, reduced it to a perfect and compleat Art and Science of Law, whereby the right skill and way of doing the pureſt and moſt natural juſtice, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the caſe be, may be taught and known; And when it has from thence been ingrafted into our own and the other Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> and made one of the three chief Sciences there, to which the reſt of the Arts ſerve as it were as handmaids and ſervants; and all for the directing of men and Nations, how they ſhould deal honeſtly and uprightly with one another; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo that our very Martial affairs cannot proceed wel, nor be rightly regulated without it; and that thoſe Nations whom we have moſt dealings and intercourſe withall, and to whom we ſhould deſpiſe to be any whit inferiour, do not onely keep it, but alſo have no other profeſſion of Law beſides it, and do think their own private Laws to be very inſufficient and lame without it; and that divers matters and cauſes amongſt our ſelves will remain without any Law at all, except the Civil Law be kept to order them, as it did before; Laſtly, when the Civil Law comes to help and aſſiſt, and not to infringe or take away from the Municipal Law at all: If we ſhall now abandon it, and caſt it
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115997:102"/>out of our coaſts, or which is all one, if we ſhall reward and encourage it ſo ſlenderly, that no man will either think it worth his pains to ſtudy, or his coſt to take any degree in it (to which paſs it is moſt viſibly come already) I ſay, if we ſhall ſtill thus neglect or deſpiſe it either way; we ſhall not onely ſet light by the Policy and Wiſdome of the Romans, which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people are ſtudious to imitate and come as near as poſſibly they can; but we ſhall alſo deprive our ſelves of one excellent means to improve our knowledge and reaſon by; our juſtice without it, being guided by illiterate and irrational principles, will be leſs ſatisfactory to the people; our skill in the diſcipline of War, and in the Laws of Armes will be very defective; the very harmony of learning, that has ſo long flouriſhed amongſt us, will be diſſolved, when ſo conſiderable a part as the Civil Law is broken off from it; other Nations will grow too wiſe and ſubtil for us, and will turn and winde us as they lift; and our juſtice at home will be lamed, not being competent enough for the matters we deal in. The conſequence of all which will be, miſchief at home, and diſhonour abroad, which all good Patriots and lovers of their Countrey will lament to ſee.</p>
